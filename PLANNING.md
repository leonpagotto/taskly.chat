# Plan

## Architecture
The system will follow a microservices architecture, composed of several loosely coupled services communicating via APIs. A central API Gateway will manage requests and authentication. Key architectural components include: 1. Conversational UI Layer: Handles user interaction, voice/text input, and displays AI responses via WebSockets for real-time communication. 2. AI Orchestration Layer: Manages interactions with various AI models (both internal and external, including user-provided API keys) for NLU, task classification, text generation, and contextual assistance. It will abstract the underlying AI service providers. 3. Core Services: Dedicated microservices for User Management (authentication, profiles), Task Management (creation, categorization, CRUD), and Habit Management (tracking, progress). 4. Data Storage: A robust relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) will store structured user, task, and habit data. AI-specific context or large language model interaction logs might be stored separately if needed. 5. Security & Identity: OAuth2/JWT for authentication and authorization across services. The architecture will be cloud-native, leveraging containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for scalability and reliability.

## Tech Stack
Frontend/Conversational UI: React/Next.js for web, React Native or Flutter for cross-platform mobile, WebSockets for real-time chat. Backend Services: Python (FastAPI/Django) for AI-heavy services and core business logic, Node.js (Express.js) for lightweight, real-time services. Database: PostgreSQL for primary data storage. AI Services: OpenAI API (initial focus), with a flexible integration layer to support other LLMs and user-provided API keys. Voice Input: Web Speech API (browser), cloud-based Speech-to-Text services (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, AWS Transcribe) for enhanced accuracy. Deployment: Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, AWS/GCP/Azure for cloud infrastructure.

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. Security & Privacy: Robust encryption for data at rest and in transit. Secure handling and storage of user-provided AI API keys. Adherence to data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms. 2. Scalability: The architecture must be designed to accommodate a rapidly growing user base, increasing data volume, and future feature expansions without significant re-architecture. 3. Performance: Low latency for AI responses (sub-second where possible) and real-time conversational interactions. Efficient processing of voice and text inputs. Fast loading times for the user interface. 4. Reliability & Availability: High system uptime (e.g., 99.9% availability). Robust error handling, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery capabilities. 5. Usability: Intuitive, frictionless, and simple conversational user experience. Accessibility compliance. Clear and consistent interaction design. 6. Maintainability: Modular code with clear separation of concerns, comprehensive API documentation, automated testing, and streamlined deployment processes to ensure ease of maintenance and future development. 7. Integrability: Flexible and well-defined APIs to facilitate future integrations with third-party services beyond AI (e.g., calendars, other productivity tools).
