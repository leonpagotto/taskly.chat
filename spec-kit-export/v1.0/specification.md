# Specification

## Summary
This project aims to build a multi-agent framework from scratch using Python and Poetry. The primary goal is to provide a fully controllable agentic system, reducing dependency on existing frameworks like AutoGen. The initial version will focus on core agentic capabilities such as reasoning, observation, and tool calling, while also prioritizing scalability, security, and reliability.

### User Personas
- Agent Application Developers
- Multi-Agent System Researchers
- Software Engineers building automation
- AI/ML Engineers

### Features
- Core multi-agent orchestration capabilities
- Agent reasoning engine for decision-making
- Observation module for agents to perceive their environment
- Robust tool calling mechanism for agents to interact with external systems and APIs
- Framework for defining and managing agent roles
- Mechanisms for inter-agent communication
- Scalable architecture to support a growing number of agents and complex interactions
- Security features for safe agent execution and data handling
- Reliability features for consistent agent operation
- Python-based development with Poetry for dependency management and packaging
