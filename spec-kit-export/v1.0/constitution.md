# Constitution

## Principles
- Agentic Core Focus: Prioritize the development of fundamental agentic capabilities (reasoning, observation, tool calling) as the primary goal.
- Developer Controllability: Design the framework to offer developers fine-grained control and transparency over agent behavior and interactions.
- Framework Independence: Strive to build core components from scratch to minimize reliance on existing large-scale agent frameworks.
- Scalability & Reliability by Design: Embed considerations for performance, resilience, and growth into the architecture from the outset.
- Security as a Foundation: Implement robust security measures to ensure safe agent execution and secure data handling.
- Pythonic & Maintainable: Adhere to Python best practices and ensure the codebase is well-structured, documented, and easily maintainable using Poetry.

## Values
- Innovation: Continuously seek novel solutions for multi-agent orchestration and autonomous systems.
- Empowerment: Provide developers with powerful and flexible tools to build sophisticated agentic systems.
- Excellence: Commit to high-quality code, robust design, and thorough testing for a reliable framework.
- Transparency: Ensure clarity in agent behavior, framework mechanics, and decision-making processes.
- Self-Reliance: Foster a culture of building foundational components to achieve true independence.

## Constraints
- Technology Stack: The framework must be developed using Python, with Poetry for dependency management and packaging.
- Initial Scope Focus: The first version must concentrate solely on core agentic capabilities: reasoning, observation, and robust tool calling, along with multi-agent orchestration.
- Framework Independence Mandate: Explicitly avoid relying on existing comprehensive multi-agent frameworks (e.g., AutoGen) for core functionalities.
- Non-functional Priorities: Scalability, security, and reliability are critical non-functional requirements to be addressed from the initial design phase.

## Team Roles
- **Tech Lead / Architect:** Define and oversee the overall system architecture, ensuring scalability, reliability, and security. Guide technical decisions and enforce coding standards. Mentor team members and conduct code reviews.
- **Lead Software Engineer (Agent Core):** Design and implement the core agentic capabilities: reasoning engine, observation module, and tool calling mechanism. Develop the framework for defining and managing agent roles and inter-agent communication. Ensure the agent core is robust, extensible, and controllable.
- **Software Engineer (Infrastructure & Scalability):** Set up and maintain the Python development environment with Poetry. Implement scalable architecture components and optimize performance. Contribute to deployment strategies and monitoring solutions.
- **Security Engineer:** Design and implement security features for safe agent execution, data handling, and external interactions. Conduct security audits and vulnerability assessments. Ensure compliance with security best practices.
- **Quality Assurance Engineer:** Develop and execute comprehensive test plans for core functionalities and multi-agent interactions. Identify, track, and re-test defects to ensure framework reliability and stability. Contribute to defining performance and reliability metrics.
- **Product Manager / Owner:** Gather and define detailed requirements from target user personas. Translate project goals into actionable features and manage the product roadmap. Address open questions regarding specific interactions, external tool integrations, and desired levels of controllability.
