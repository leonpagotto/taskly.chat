# Plan

## Architecture
The framework will adopt a modular and layered architecture, emphasizing separation of concerns for core functionalities. At its heart will be an `Agent Manager` responsible for the lifecycle and orchestration of agents. Each `Agent` instance will encapsulate its own `Reasoning Engine`, `Observation Module`, and `Tool Calling Mechanism`. A central `Communication Bus` (likely implemented asynchronously in-process initially) will facilitate inter-agent communication. A `Tool Registry` will manage available external tools and their secure invocation. A dedicated `Security Layer` will be integrated throughout, ensuring safe execution environments (e.g., sandboxing) and secure data handling. The design will prioritize extensibility, allowing developers to plug in custom reasoning models, observation processors, and tools. Asynchronous programming (Python's `asyncio`) will be fundamental to enable concurrent agent operations and support scalability. Observability features, including comprehensive logging and debugging hooks, will be built in to provide transparency and controllability over agent behaviors.

## Tech Stack
The entire framework will be developed using Python 3.9+ as the primary programming language. Poetry will be used exclusively for dependency management, packaging, and virtual environment creation. For asynchronous operations and concurrent execution, Python's built-in `asyncio` library will be leveraged. Inter-agent communication will initially rely on in-process asynchronous queues, with potential for lightweight message brokers (e.g., Redis Pub/Sub if distribution is needed later, but not in core initial scope) for more advanced scenarios. For interacting with external APIs, the `httpx` or `requests` library will be used for HTTP calls. Unit and integration testing will be performed using `pytest`. Code quality will be enforced with `black` for formatting, `flake8` for linting, and `isort` for import sorting.

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Scalability**: The framework must be designed to support a growing number of concurrent agents and complex multi-agent interactions without significant performance degradation, utilizing asynchronous processing. 2. **Security**: Robust security measures will be implemented, including safe agent execution environments (e.g., sandboxing), secure handling of sensitive data, and controlled access mechanisms for external tools and APIs. 3. **Reliability**: The system must operate consistently, providing robust error handling, fault tolerance, and recovery mechanisms to ensure continuous agent operation. 4. **Developer Controllability**: Developers must have fine-grained control and transparency over agent behavior, internal state, decision-making processes, and inter-agent communication flows. 5. **Performance**: Core agentic capabilities (reasoning, observation, tool calling) and inter-agent communication should execute efficiently with minimal latency. 6. **Maintainability**: The codebase must be modular, well-structured, thoroughly documented, and adhere to Pythonic best practices, making it easy to understand, extend, and debug. 7. **Extensibility**: The architecture must support easy integration of custom reasoning engines, observation components, new tools, and alternative communication patterns.
