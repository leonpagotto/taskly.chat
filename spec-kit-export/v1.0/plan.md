# Plan

## Architecture
A microservices-based architecture to ensure scalability, adaptability, and independent deployment of components. Key services would include: 1. Inventory Service: Manages all product and stock-related data. 2. Order Service: Handles customer orders and their lifecycle. 3. Warehouse Operations Service: Manages receiving, put-away, picking, packing, and shipping processes. 4. Store Operations Service: Manages in-store activities like selling, returns, and display. 5. Transfer Service: Orchestrates stock movements between warehouse and store. 6. User Service: Manages authentication, authorization, and user profiles. 7. Reporting/Dashboard Service: Aggregates data from other services for analytics and visualization. An API Gateway would sit in front of these services to handle request routing, security, and rate limiting. A single-page application (SPA) would serve as the user interface for all personas, interacting with the backend services via RESTful APIs.

## Tech Stack
Backend: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js (Express.js) for microservices, PostgreSQL for relational data storage (inventory, orders, users), Redis for caching and real-time data needs. Frontend: React.js or Vue.js for a responsive and intuitive user interface. Containerization: Docker for packaging microservices. Cloud Platform: AWS (EC2, RDS, ECS/EKS) or Google Cloud Platform (Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, GKE) for scalable deployment and managed services. API Gateway: NGINX or AWS API Gateway. Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

## Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: The system should handle up to 1,000 inventory items and 100 daily transactions with sub-second response times for critical operations. Scalability: The architecture must support horizontal scaling to accommodate future growth in inventory volume and transaction rates. Data Accuracy: Inventory levels and order statuses must be accurate with real-time updates across all locations to prevent discrepancies. Usability: The user interface should be intuitive and efficient for all user personas, requiring minimal training. Security: User authentication and authorization must be robust, protecting sensitive inventory and sales data. Data Integrity: Transactions must be atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID compliant) to prevent data corruption. Maintainability: The codebase should be modular, well-documented, and follow best practices to facilitate future enhancements and bug fixes. Reliability: The system should have high availability (e.g., 99.9%) and robust error handling to minimize downtime.
