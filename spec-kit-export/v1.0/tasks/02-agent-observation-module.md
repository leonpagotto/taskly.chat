## Story: Agent Observation Module

**Description:**
As an Agent Application Developer, I want agents to perceive and process information from their environment, so that they can gather necessary context for their reasoning.

### Tasks

- [ ] **Design Agent Observation Data Model** [Lead Software Engineer (Agent Core)]
  - Define the data structures for observations within the framework. This includes specifying fields for the observation source, timestamp, raw content, and a structured format for processed context. The design should prioritize extensibility to accommodate various data types and future enhancements.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A formal data schema (e.g., Pydantic model) for `RawObservation` and `ProcessedObservation` is defined.
        *   Includes fields for `source_id`, `timestamp`, `raw_data` (polymorphic), and `metadata`.
        *   `ProcessedObservation` includes a `context` field suitable for agent reasoning.
        *   The model allows for easy addition of new observation types without breaking existing interfaces.
- [ ] **Implement Core Observation Reception Mechanism** [Lead Software Engineer (Agent Core)]
  - Develop the foundational component responsible for receiving raw environmental information from various sources. This mechanism should be asynchronous and non-blocking, aligning with the `asyncio` paradigm.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   An `ObservationReceiver` component is implemented that can accept raw observation data.
        *   Provides a standardized `async` method (e.g., `receive(source_id: str, data: Any)`) for external entities to push observations.
        *   Automatically timestamps observations upon reception.
        *   Utilizes `asyncio` queues for internal buffering if necessary to decouple reception from processing.
        *   Gracefully handles concurrent observation inputs.
- [ ] **Implement Observation Processing Pipeline** [Lead Software Engineer (Agent Core)]
  - Create a configurable pipeline to transform raw observations into a standardized, context-rich format that is directly usable by the agent's reasoning engine. This pipeline should support multiple processing steps like parsing, filtering, and contextualization.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A `ObservationProcessor` class is implemented, capable of chaining multiple processing steps.
        *   Supports dynamic registration of processing functions/plugins.
        *   Each step takes a `RawObservation` and returns a `ProcessedObservation` (or an intermediate state).
        *   Handles potential errors during individual processing steps without halting the entire pipeline.
        *   Output `ProcessedObservation` conforms to the defined data model.
- [ ] **Integrate Observation Module with Agent Reasoning Engine** [Lead Software Engineer (Agent Core)]
  - Ensure that the processed observations are effectively delivered to and accessible by the agent's core reasoning component. This task involves defining the interface through which agents consume contextualized information.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The `Agent` core class has a clear method (e.g., `_on_observation(observation: ProcessedObservation)`) to receive processed observations.
        *   The observation pipeline automatically routes processed observations to the relevant agent instances.
        *   Agents can query or access a historical log of recent processed observations relevant to their context.
        *   The integration point is documented and allows for future extensions (e.g., selective observation delivery).
- [ ] **Develop Unit and Integration Tests for Observation Module** [Quality Assurance Engineer]
  - Create comprehensive test suites to validate the functionality and reliability of the observation reception, processing, and integration components. This includes unit tests for individual functions and integration tests for the end-to-end data flow.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Unit tests are written using `pytest` for `ObservationReceiver` and `ObservationProcessor` components.
        *   Integration tests cover the full lifecycle: raw data input -> reception -> processing -> delivery to a mock agent.
        *   Test cases include valid data, malformed data, edge cases (e.g., empty observations), and concurrent inputs.
        *   Mocks are used appropriately for external dependencies during unit testing.
        *   High test coverage (e.g., >90%) is achieved for the observation module's core logic.
- [ ] **Define and Implement Observation Data Security Guidelines** [Security Engineer]
  - Address potential security vulnerabilities related to observation data, particularly concerning sensitive information. This involves defining policies and implementing mechanisms for data sanitization, redaction, or access control.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A threat model is developed for observation data, identifying potential risks like data leakage or unauthorized access.
        *   Guidelines are established for identifying and classifying sensitive data within observations (e.g., PII, API keys).
        *   A configurable mechanism (e.g., a processing step in the pipeline) is implemented to redact or mask sensitive information before it's exposed to the agent core or logged.
        *   Considerations for access control based on observation source or sensitivity are documented for future implementation.
- [ ] **Architectural Review of Observation Module Design** [Tech Lead / Architect]
  - Conduct a thorough review of the proposed design and initial implementation of the observation module. This ensures alignment with the overall framework architecture, performance goals, scalability requirements, and adherence to `asyncio` best practices.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The design document and initial code for the observation module are reviewed and feedback is provided.
        *   Ensures consistency with the overall `asyncio` framework and inter-agent communication patterns.
        *   Potential architectural bottlenecks or performance implications related to high observation volumes are identified.
        *   The module's extensibility and maintainability are evaluated.
        *   Security considerations are reviewed to ensure robust implementation.
