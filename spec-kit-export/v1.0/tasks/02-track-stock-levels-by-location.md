## Story: Track Stock Levels by Location

**Description:**
As a Warehouse Manager/Store Manager, I want to see real-time stock levels for each product, broken down by warehouse and store locations, so I can monitor available inventory and plan transfers or reorders.

### Tasks

- [ ] **Design Database Schema for Inventory and Locations** [Lead Developer]
  - Design and document the database schema to store product inventory, including product details, quantity, and location (warehouse/store). This should support efficient querying for real-time stock levels by location.
    
    *   Define `products` table with product ID, name, description, etc.
    *   Define `locations` table with location ID, type (warehouse/store), name, etc.
    *   Define `inventory` table linking `products`, `locations`, and `quantity`.
    *   Consider indexing for performance on common lookups (product_id, location_id).
- [ ] **Develop API Endpoint for Real-time Stock Levels** [Backend Developer]
  - Create a backend API endpoint that retrieves real-time stock levels for all products, broken down by their respective warehouse and store locations. This endpoint should be optimized for quick responses.
    
    *   Implement a GET endpoint, e.g., `/api/inventory/stock` or `/api/products/{productId}/stock`.
    *   The endpoint should return product details, and for each product, a list of locations with their current stock quantity.
    *   Implement efficient database queries to fetch data.
    *   Include error handling for invalid requests or no data found.
- [ ] **Implement Frontend UI for Stock Level Display** [Frontend Developer]
  - Develop the user interface to display real-time stock levels, allowing warehouse and store managers to easily view inventory broken down by location.
    
    *   Create a dedicated 'Stock Levels' page or section in the dashboard.
    *   Display a table or list of products with columns for product name, total stock, and individual stock levels for each defined warehouse and store location.
    *   Implement search and filtering capabilities (e.g., by product name, location).
    *   Ensure the UI is responsive and user-friendly.
- [ ] **Integrate Frontend with Stock Level API** [Frontend Developer]
  - Connect the frontend stock level display with the backend API to fetch and render real-time inventory data.
    
    *   Utilize asynchronous API calls (e.g., Axios, Fetch API) to retrieve data from the `/api/inventory/stock` endpoint.
    *   Handle loading states, errors, and empty data scenarios gracefully in the UI.
    *   Ensure data is correctly parsed and displayed in the respective UI components.
- [ ] **Write Unit and Integration Tests for Stock API** [QA Engineer]
  - Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for the stock level API endpoint to ensure its correctness, performance, and reliability.
    
    *   Write unit tests for database interaction logic and data retrieval.
    *   Write integration tests to verify the API endpoint's response structure and data accuracy under various conditions (e.g., no stock, multiple locations, invalid product IDs).
    *   Ensure test coverage is adequate for critical paths.
- [ ] **Write End-to-End Tests for Stock Level Feature** [QA Engineer]
  - Create end-to-end tests to validate the complete user flow for viewing stock levels by location, from data retrieval to UI display.
    
    *   Use a testing framework (e.g., Cypress, Selenium) to simulate user interactions.
    *   Verify that correct stock data is displayed in the frontend for different products and locations.
    *   Test filtering and search functionalities.
    *   Ensure the real-time aspect is reflected (potentially by mocking data updates).
- [ ] **Develop Product and Location Data Seeding/Management** [Backend Developer]
  - Implement initial data seeding for products and locations, and provide basic mechanisms (e.g., administrative API/UI) for Product Owner/Administrator to manage this data.
    
    *   Create scripts or an API for adding/editing product details.
    *   Create scripts or an API for defining/editing warehouse and store locations.
    *   Ensure that inventory can be associated with these products and locations.
- [ ] **Review and Optimize Database Queries for Performance** [Backend Developer]
  - Review the database queries used for fetching stock levels and optimize them for performance, especially as the number of products and locations grows.
    
    *   Analyze query execution plans.
    *   Add or adjust database indexes as needed.
    *   Consider caching strategies (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed stock data if performance becomes a bottleneck.
    *   Work with Lead Developer to ensure scalability.
- [ ] **Validate Stock Level Display with Operations Leads** [Product Owner/Administrator]
  - Conduct a review session with the Warehouse Operations Lead and Store Operations Lead to ensure the stock level display meets their requirements and accurately reflects operational needs.
    
    *   Gather feedback on clarity, completeness, and usability of the displayed information.
    *   Confirm that all necessary data points (product, quantity, location) are present and correct.
    *   Identify any missing features or necessary adjustments from an operational perspective.
