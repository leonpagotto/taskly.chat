## 3. Plan

### Architecture
The system will adopt a Microservices Architecture, with distinct services handling core functionalities such as: 1. **Chat/Conversation Service:** Manages real-time communication, message persistence, and conversational flow using WebSockets. 2. **AI/NLP Service:** Dedicated to processing natural language input, generating user stories, tasks, specifications, and managing project memory/instructions. This service will host and orchestrate LLMs and other NLP models. 3. **Project Management Service:** Manages structured project data (epics, stories, tasks, versions), relationships, and state transitions. 4. **User/Auth Service:** Handles user authentication, authorization, profiles, and team management. 5. **Notification/Automation Service:** Manages event-driven alerts, reminders, and context-rich automations. 6. **Data Storage Layer:** Utilizes a polyglot persistence approach with a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured project data and user information, a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB/DynamoDB) for conversational history or flexible document storage, and potentially a vector database for AI context and embeddings. API Gateway will manage external requests, routing them to appropriate microservices. An event bus (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ) will facilitate asynchronous communication between services. Frontend applications (web and potentially desktop) will interact with the API Gateway and Chat Service via WebSockets for real-time updates.

### Tech Stack
1. **Frontend:** React.js / Next.js (for web application), Electron.js (for potential desktop client), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS. 2. **Backend Services:** Node.js with NestJS/Fastify (for API Gateway, Chat Service, Project Management Service, User/Auth Service, Notification Service), Python with FastAPI (for AI/NLP Service and ML inference). 3. **Real-time Communication:** Socket.IO / WebSockets. 4. **Databases:** PostgreSQL (for structured project data, user accounts, and relationships), Redis (for caching, session management, and real-time message brokering), potentially a Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate) for AI context retrieval and embeddings. 5. **AI/ML:** Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers) for custom LLM fine-tuning and NLP tasks; leveraging cloud AI services (e.g., OpenAI API, Google Cloud AI Platform, AWS SageMaker) for general-purpose language models. 6. **Cloud Platform:** AWS (EC2 for compute, S3 for storage, RDS for PostgreSQL, EKS for Kubernetes, Lambda for serverless functions, SageMaker for ML operations). 7. **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes. 8. **Message Broker:** Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for inter-service communication and event streaming. 9. **Version Control:** Git (GitHub/GitLab).

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Scalability:** The system must support a growing number of concurrent users, projects, and AI interactions without degradation in performance, especially for real-time collaboration and AI processing. 2. **Performance:** Low latency for conversational AI responses, real-time chat, and rapid retrieval of project data is critical to provide a seamless user experience. 3. **Reliability & Availability:** High uptime is required for a project management tool; the system should be fault-tolerant with robust error handling and monitoring. 4. **Security:** All user data, project information, and AI models must be secured against unauthorized access, including robust authentication, authorization, data encryption (at rest and in transit), and compliance with data privacy regulations. 5. **Data Integrity:** Ensure consistency and accuracy of all project data, conversational history, and AI-generated content, especially concerning versioning and persistent instructions. 6. **AI Accuracy & Effectiveness:** The AI-powered features (story generation, task extraction, context retention) must consistently deliver clear, accurate, and engineer-ready outputs to reduce manual effort and handoff friction. 7. **Usability:** The user interface must be intuitive, conversation-centric, and provide an engaging experience for human-AI collaboration. 8. **Maintainability:** The architecture and codebase should be well-documented, modular, and easy to update, allowing for continuous integration of new features and AI model improvements. 9. **Observability:** Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing capabilities are essential for tracking system health, AI model performance, and identifying issues proactively. 10. **Extensibility:** The system should be designed to easily integrate new AI models, third-party services, and expand with future features.
