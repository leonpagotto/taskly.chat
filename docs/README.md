Documents are moved to `/archive` when:
- The feature is fully implemented and stable
- The documentation is historical (implementation logs, update summaries)
- The information is no longer actively referenced but may be useful for historical context

Documents are deleted when:
- They are completely obsolete
- They contain outdated/incorrect information
- They duplicate other documentation
