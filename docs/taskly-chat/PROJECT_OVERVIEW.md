- The Individual Seeking Work-Life Balance (Desires a single platform to manage personal errands, reminders, habits, and professional responsibilities without feeling compartmentalized.)
- The Creative/Strategist (Requires an AI partner for brainstorming, outlining, and structuring abstract ideas into actionable plans.)
- Team Collaborators (Needs a way to share projects or discussions, maintain consistent context, and leverage AI assistance within a team setting.)

### Features
- Natural Language Interaction: Core functionality for all interactions, allowing users to converse as they would with a human.
- Conversation History Management: Preservation and organization of chat history within projects or threads for continuity.
- Persistent Personal Memory: AI remembers user preferences, routines, priorities, and important dates, applying this context to future interactions.
- Customizable Instructions & Guidance: Users can set global or project-specific instructions (e.g., tone, goals) to guide AI outputs consistently.
- Smart Automations & Context-Aware Reminders: Automated nudges, insights, and progress tracking based on context, calendar, and other integrated data.
- Unified Personal & Professional Management: Supports tasks and goals from both personal life (e.g., reminders, habit tracking) and professional work (e.g., project planning, drafting).
- Optional Collaboration & Sharing: Ability to share projects or threads with others, ensuring consistent AI behavior for collaborators.
- Integration with Third-Party Apps: Capability to connect with external services for surfacing information and enabling automated actions.

# Constitution

## Principles
- Prioritize natural and intuitive human-AI interaction for all user engagement.
- Ensure AI memory is persistent, context-aware, and enhances every user interaction.
- Strive for effortless productivity and a balanced user life by reducing cognitive load.
- Design for adaptability and seamless integration across personal and professional domains.
- Foster a culture of continuous learning and intelligent automation to anticipate user needs.

## Values
- User-Centric Design: Always design with the user's natural thought processes and communication in mind, empowering them to manage their life.
- Contextual Intelligence: Value the deep understanding and application of user context and memory to provide meaningful and relevant assistance.
- Simplicity & Clarity: Transform complex ideas and tasks into effortless, clear, and actionable interactions.
- Innovation & Adaptability: Embrace cutting-edge AI and technology to provide flexible, evolving, and future-proof solutions.
- Privacy & Trust: Uphold the highest standards for user data privacy, security, and system reliability, building unwavering trust.

## Constraints
- Initial third-party integrations must be prioritized based on highest user impact and technical feasibility, with defined read/write capabilities.
- Collaboration features require robust definition of user roles, permissions, and comprehensive privacy controls for shared projects/threads.
- Memory management mechanisms, including explicit user control to 'forget' and a dedicated UI, must be clearly defined and implemented.
- Specific 'Smart Automation' nudges, insights, and progress tracking types, along with their configuration and presentation, need detailed specification prior to development.
- Adherence to the capabilities and limitations of the 'lobe-chat framework' will guide UI/UX and integration strategies to ensure system flexibility and performance.

## Team Roles
- **Product Manager:** Define and prioritize features based on user personas and project vision. Translate user needs into actionable requirements. Own the product roadmap, ensuring alignment with business goals and market needs. Facilitate communication between stakeholders and the development team.
- **AI/Machine Learning Engineer:** Develop, train, and optimize natural language processing (NLP) models for conversational interaction. Implement and refine the persistent personal memory system and context-aware intelligence. Design and integrate smart automation algorithms and insight generation. Research and apply new AI techniques to enhance system capabilities.
- **Full-stack Software Engineer:** Develop the core application architecture, APIs, and backend services. Implement third-party integrations and data synchronization mechanisms. Build and maintain the front-end user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience. Ensure scalability, performance, and security of the overall platform.
- **UX/UI Designer:** Design intuitive and natural conversational flows and user interactions. Create user interfaces that align with human thought processes and communication styles. Conduct user research and testing to validate designs and gather feedback. Ensure consistency and accessibility across all user touchpoints.
- **Quality Assurance Engineer:** Develop and execute test plans for all features, including natural language interaction, memory, and automations. Identify, document, and track bugs and inconsistencies across the platform. Verify third-party integrations and automation logic. Ensure the system meets performance, reliability, and security standards.

# Plan

## Architecture
The Taskly.chat system will adopt a modular, microservices-based architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. A client-side application (web and potentially mobile) will interact with a secure API Gateway. Behind the gateway, specialized microservices will handle distinct functionalities: a Conversational AI Service for natural language processing and LLM interaction; a Memory Management Service for persistent user context and preferences; an Automation & Reminders Service for intelligent nudges and scheduling; an Integration Service for connecting with third-party applications; and a User & Collaboration Service for user authentication, authorization, and project sharing. Data persistence will leverage a combination of relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured user and project data, a vector database (e.g., Pinecone) for efficient AI memory retrieval, and potentially NoSQL databases for conversation history. Asynchronous communication between services will be managed via a message queue (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ) to ensure responsiveness and resilience.

## Tech Stack
Frontend: React (Web SPA) with potential for React Native (Cross-platform Mobile) to ensure a consistent and responsive user experience. Backend: Python (for AI/ML heavy services leveraging libraries like LangChain, Hugging Face, OpenAI API) and Node.js (for I/O bound services, API Gateway, and general microservices) to balance AI capabilities with high-performance async operations. Databases: PostgreSQL (for core relational data like user profiles, projects, permissions), Pinecone/Weaviate (for vector-based memory storage to enable contextual retrieval for AI), and Redis (for caching, session management, and message queueing). Cloud Platform: AWS/Azure/GCP for scalable infrastructure, managed services, and compute resources. Containerization: Docker and Kubernetes for efficient deployment and orchestration of microservices. Other: OAuth2.0 for secure third-party integrations, WebSockets for real-time interactions if required.

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance: Sub-second response times for core conversational interactions and memory retrieval. 2. Scalability: Ability to handle millions of users and billions of memory entries without degradation, scaling horizontally by adding service instances. 3. Reliability: High availability (99.9% uptime), fault tolerance through redundancy, and robust error handling. 4. Security: End-to-end encryption (data at rest and in transit), robust authentication (OAuth2.0) and authorization mechanisms, strict access control for shared projects, and regular security audits. 5. Data Privacy & Compliance: Adherence to GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant data privacy regulations, providing users granular control over their personal memory and data, including explicit 'forget' mechanisms. 6. Usability: Intuitive, natural, and low-friction conversational interface with a consistent user experience across web and potential mobile platforms, designed with accessibility in mind. 7. Extensibility: Modular architecture enabling easy addition of new AI capabilities, automation types, and third-party integrations. 8. Maintainability: Well-documented APIs, clean code, automated testing, and CI/CD pipelines for efficient development and deployment. 9. Observability: Comprehensive logging, monitoring (metrics and traces), and alerting across all services for proactive issue detection and resolution.
