Develop the backend services required to handle the OAuth 2.0 flow with Google for Calendar API.
*   Configure Google API project credentials (client ID, client secret, redirect URIs).
*   Implement endpoints for initiating the OAuth flow (redirect to Google).
*   Implement callback endpoints to handle authorization codes and exchange them for access/refresh tokens.
*   Securely store encrypted refresh tokens and associated user metadata in the database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
*   Implement a mechanism to refresh access tokens using stored refresh tokens.
