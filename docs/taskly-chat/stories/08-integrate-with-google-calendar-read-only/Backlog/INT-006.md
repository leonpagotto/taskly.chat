responsibleArea: AI/Machine Learning Engineer

Enhance the AI's capabilities to consume and utilize the synchronized Google Calendar event data.
*   Develop logic to retrieve relevant calendar events for a given user query or context.
*   Integrate event data into the AI's prompt engineering process or knowledge base (e.g., using vector embeddings in Pinecone/Weaviate or LangChain context management).
*   Refine existing or develop new AI models/prompts to generate accurate and timely suggestions and reminders based on the user's schedule.
*   Ensure the AI respects the read-only nature and doesn't attempt to modify calendar events.
