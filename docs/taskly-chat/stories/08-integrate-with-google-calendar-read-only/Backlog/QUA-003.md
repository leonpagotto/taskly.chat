Develop and execute a comprehensive test plan for the Google Calendar integration.
*   **Functional Testing:**
    *   Verify successful OAuth connection and disconnection.
    *   Confirm correct fetching and storage of calendar events.
    *   Test event fetching for different time ranges (past, present, future).
    *   Validate handling of calendars with many events, empty calendars.
    *   Test scenarios where Google API returns errors (e.g., rate limits, invalid tokens).
*   **Security Testing:**
    *   Verify secure storage and retrieval of access/refresh tokens.
    *   Ensure only read-only access is requested and enforced.
*   **AI Integration Testing:**
    *   Verify AI can correctly interpret and use calendar events for suggestions and reminders (e.g., 'What's my next meeting?', 'Remind me 15 minutes before my appointment').
    *   Test various prompts to ensure AI leverages calendar data effectively.
