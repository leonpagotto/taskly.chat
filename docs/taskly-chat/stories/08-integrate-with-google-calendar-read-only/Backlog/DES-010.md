id: DES-010
title: Design Database Schema and Implement Initial Calendar Data Sync
responsibleArea: Full-stack Software Engineer
---
Design and implement the necessary database schema (PostgreSQL) to store Google Calendar integration details and fetched event data.
*   Schema for storing user-specific Google integration credentials (e.g., `google_accounts` table linked to `users`, storing encrypted `refresh_token`, `access_token` related metadata).
*   Schema for storing cached calendar events (e.g., `calendar_events` table with fields like `event_id`, `title`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `description`, `calendar_id`, `user_id`, `last_synced_at`).
*   Implement an initial data synchronization process to fetch events immediately after a successful connection.
