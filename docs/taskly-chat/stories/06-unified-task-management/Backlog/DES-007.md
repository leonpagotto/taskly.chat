Design the user interface for a single, unified view of all tasks, accommodating both personal and professional types, and the conversational interaction patterns. This involves:
*   Wireframes and mockups for the main task list/dashboard, including filtering, sorting, and search capabilities.
*   Design for task creation and editing forms, ensuring clear distinction and selection of task categories.
*   Consideration for task states (e.g., pending, completed) and visual indicators.
*   Propose natural conversational flows for task interaction via chat, including creation, update, and query.
