id: INT-005
title: Integrate NLP Task Extraction Service into Backend
responsibleArea: Full-stack Software Engineer
---
Integrate the developed NLP model (from TASK-005) into the backend services to enable intelligent task creation and updates from natural language. This includes:
*   Creating an internal service endpoint that receives raw user text input.
*   Calling the AI/ML task extraction service and handling its structured output.
*   Mapping the extracted data to the `Task` data model.
*   Implementing logic to create or update tasks based on the parsed information, possibly requiring user confirmation for ambiguous cases.
*   Ensuring robust error handling and fallback mechanisms if NLP parsing fails.
