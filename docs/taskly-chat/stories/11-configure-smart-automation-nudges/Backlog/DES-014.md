responsibleArea: UX/UI Designer
---
Design wireframes, mockups, and interaction flows for the user interface allowing users to configure different types of 'nudges,' 'insights,' and 'progress tracking' provided by Taskly.chat. This includes:
*   Identifying common configuration patterns (e.g., toggles, dropdowns, input fields for frequency).
*   Ensuring clarity and ease of use for setting conditions (e.g., 'remind me if a task is overdue for X days').
*   Creating a consistent visual and interactive experience aligned with Taskly.chat's design language.
