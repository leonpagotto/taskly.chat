responsibleArea: Quality Assurance Engineer

Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for the backend API endpoints and permission enforcement logic.
- Unit tests cover individual functions/methods related to role assignment and permission checks.

- Test cases cover edge cases like unauthorized attempts, invalid roles, and non-existent users/projects.
- Test coverage metrics meet predefined project standards.
