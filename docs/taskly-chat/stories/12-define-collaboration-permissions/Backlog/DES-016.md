Create intuitive user interface designs and interaction flows for users to manage project collaborators and their roles.
- Wireframes and high-fidelity mockups for a 'Share Project' or 'Project Settings' section showing current collaborators.
- Design for adding new collaborators, including user search/selection.
- Design for role selection dropdowns or radio buttons for each collaborator with clear descriptions of each role's capabilities.
- Design for removing collaborators.
- Designs are consistent with Taskly's overall design system.
