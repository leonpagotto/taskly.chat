title: Backend API for Saving Conversation Messages
responsibleArea: Full-stack Software Engineer
---
Develop a secure backend API endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/v1/conversations/messages`) to receive and persist conversation messages into the PostgreSQL database. This API should handle messages originating from both users and the AI assistant.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   API endpoint is authenticated and authorized.
    *   Successfully stores message content, sender, timestamp, and associated project/thread ID.
    *   Handles edge cases such as missing project/thread IDs or invalid input.
    *   Returns a success response upon successful message persistence.
