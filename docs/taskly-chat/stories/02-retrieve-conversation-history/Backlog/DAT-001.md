id: DAT-001
title: Database Schema Design for Conversation History
responsibleArea: Full-stack Software Engineer
---
Design and implement the necessary database schema in PostgreSQL to store individual conversation messages. This schema should link messages to users, specific projects, and threads, ensuring proper organization. Key fields will include `message_id`, `user_id`, `project_id`, `thread_id`, `content` (text of the message), `timestamp`, and `sender_type` (e.g., 'user', 'ai').
