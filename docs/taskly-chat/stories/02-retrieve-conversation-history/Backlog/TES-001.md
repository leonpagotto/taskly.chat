    *   **Functional Tests:** Verify messages are saved and retrieved correctly, linked to the right project/thread, and displayed accurately in the UI.
    *   **API Tests:** Test positive and negative scenarios for both saving and retrieving messages.
    *   **UI Tests:** Ensure the frontend component correctly displays history, handles pagination, and shows accurate sender/timestamps.
    *   **Performance Tests:** Evaluate the speed of history retrieval for small and large datasets.
    *   **Security Tests:** Verify unauthorized users cannot access other users' conversation history.
