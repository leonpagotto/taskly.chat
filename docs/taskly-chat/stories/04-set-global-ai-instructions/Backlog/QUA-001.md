Develop and execute a comprehensive test plan to ensure the functionality, reliability, and consistency of the global AI instructions feature.
*   **Frontend Testing:**
    *   Verify UI rendering, input field functionality, and responsiveness.
    *   Test client-side validation messages and saving/loading states.
    *   Ensure all instruction types (tone, detail, custom) can be set and displayed correctly.
*   **Backend API Testing:**
    *   Test `GET` and `PUT` endpoints with valid, invalid, and edge-case data.
    *   Verify authentication and authorization controls.
    *   Confirm data persistence and retrieval accuracy from the database.
*   **AI Behavior Testing:**
    *   Design test cases for various global instruction combinations (e.g., 'formal tone, high detail', 'casual tone, concise').
    *   Verify that AI responses consistently align with the set instructions in different conversational contexts and task types.
    *   Identify any scenarios where instructions might be ignored or lead to unexpected AI behavior.
*   **Performance Testing:** Assess the impact of instruction retrieval and application on AI response times.
*   **Security Testing:** Conduct basic security checks for unauthorized access or data manipulation.
