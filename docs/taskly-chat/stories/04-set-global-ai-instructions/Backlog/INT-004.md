title: Integrate Global AI Instructions into AI Model Prompting
responsibleArea: AI/Machine Learning Engineer
---
Modify the AI core services to retrieve and incorporate the user's global AI instructions into its prompting and response generation process.
*   **Instruction Retrieval:** Develop a service layer or utility to fetch the current user's global AI instructions from the database via the backend API or directly from a cache.
*   **Dynamic Prompt Engineering:** Adapt existing prompt templates to dynamically inject parameters like `preferredTone`, `defaultDetailLevel`, and `customInstructions` into the prompts sent to the LLM.
*   **Contextual Application:** Ensure that the global instructions are consistently applied across all AI-generated responses and automated actions, unless overridden by specific task-level instructions.
*   **Testing and Validation:** Implement unit and integration tests to verify that the AI models are correctly interpreting and adhering to the global instructions.
