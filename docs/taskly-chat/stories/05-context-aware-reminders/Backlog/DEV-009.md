Implement the frontend components for users to interact with calendar integrations and context-aware reminders:
*   Build UI for users to connect their external calendars (initiate OAuth flow).
*   Display upcoming context-aware reminders in a user-friendly format within the Taskly interface.
*   Provide controls for users to acknowledge, snooze, edit, or dismiss context-aware reminders.
*   Integrate with backend APIs for managing reminders and displaying calendar status.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Users can successfully connect/disconnect their external calendars.
    *   Context-aware reminders are displayed clearly in the UI.
    *   Users can interact with reminders (e.g., mark as complete, snooze, dismiss) from the frontend.
