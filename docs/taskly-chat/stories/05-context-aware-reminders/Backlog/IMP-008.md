Build the backend service responsible for scheduling and delivering reminders:
*   Design and implement a database schema for storing context-aware reminders (including trigger conditions, notification preferences).
*   Develop a scheduling engine that periodically checks for upcoming reminders based on defined conditions (time, location, context).
*   Integrate with a notification mechanism (e.g., internal chat notification, push notification, email).
*   Implement logic for reminder persistence and updates.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Reminders are stored persistently and can be retrieved.
    *   Scheduled reminders are triggered and notifications sent at the appropriate time/context.
    *   Ability to update or dismiss a scheduled reminder via API.
