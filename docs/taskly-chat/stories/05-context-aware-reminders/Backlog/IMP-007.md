Develop the backend services for integrating with external calendar providers:
*   Research and select primary calendar API (e.g., Google Calendar API).
*   Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow for user authorization.
*   Develop APIs to securely fetch user's calendar events (title, description, start/end times, attendees).
*   Ensure secure storage of access tokens and refresh tokens.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Successful OAuth 2.0 handshake with at least one major calendar provider (e.g., Google Calendar).
    *   API endpoint capable of retrieving a user's calendar events for a specified date range.
    *   Secure storage and refresh mechanism for user calendar credentials.
