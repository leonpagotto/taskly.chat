title: Develop NLP Model for Context-Aware Reminder Intent Detection and Contextualization
responsibleArea: AI/Machine Learning Engineer
---
Enhance the AI's understanding capabilities to infer and contextualize reminders:
*   Develop and train NLP models (leveraging LangChain/Hugging Face) to detect implicit and explicit reminder intent from conversational input.
*   Implement logic to extract entities like time, date, specific events, and people from conversation.
*   Develop a module to merge extracted entities with calendar data for comprehensive context.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   High accuracy (e.g., >90%) in detecting reminder intent in test conversations.
    *   Ability to extract relevant entities (time, date, task) with high precision.
    *   System can successfully link conversational cues with corresponding calendar events (e.g., "that meeting tomorrow" links to a calendar entry).
