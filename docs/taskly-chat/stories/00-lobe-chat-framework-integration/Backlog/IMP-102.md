Implement adapter translating our `InstructionLayer` array into the shape expected by Lobe Chat for system prompt customization.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Adapter function with tests (once test harness added).
- Graceful handling of empty layers.
- Single exported util from `@taskly/ai` or a new `@taskly/integration` package.
