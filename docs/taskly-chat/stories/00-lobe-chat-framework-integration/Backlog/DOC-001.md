responsibleArea: Full-stack Software Engineer

Add architecture subsection clarifying which concerns stay in upstream framework vs Taskly domain packages.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Section added to `ARCHITECTURE.md` describing Lobe integration boundaries (framework vs Taskly ownership, extension points).
- Upgrade strategy & fork avoidance policy documented.
- Workspace Module Resolution Strategy documented (paths, composite builds, no transpilePackages, barrel export conventions, client component directive usage).
- Task status updated to Completed once architecture doc reflects both scopes.
