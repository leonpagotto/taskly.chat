title: Ensure Consistent AI Context Across Collaborators
responsibleArea: AI/Machine Learning Engineer
---
Implement mechanisms to guarantee that AI context (memory, conversation history, and derived insights) remains consistent for all collaborators within a shared project.
*   **Unified Vector Store Access**: Ensure that all collaborators accessing a shared project query and update the *same* Pinecone/Weaviate vector store namespace or collection for that project.
*   **Shared Conversation History**: The AI system must retrieve and process the complete conversation history for the shared project, regardless of which collaborator initiated the last interaction.
*   **Atomic Memory Updates**: Address potential race conditions or conflicts if multiple collaborators interact with the AI simultaneously, ensuring memory updates are consistent and reflected for all.
