Implement RESTful API endpoints to handle project sharing operations.
*   **POST /projects/{projectId}/share**: Endpoint to share a project with a new collaborator, specifying user ID/email and permission level.
*   **PUT /projects/{projectId}/share/{collaboratorId}**: Endpoint to update a collaborator's permission level.
*   **DELETE /projects/{projectId}/share/{collaboratorId}**: Endpoint to remove a collaborator's access.
*   **GET /projects/{projectId}/collaborators**: Endpoint to retrieve a list of collaborators and their permissions for a given project.
*   Implement robust authentication and authorization checks to ensure only project owners or admins can manage sharing.
