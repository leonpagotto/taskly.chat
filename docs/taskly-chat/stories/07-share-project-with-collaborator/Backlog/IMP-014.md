title: Implement Access Control Logic for Shared Projects
responsibleArea: Full-stack Software Engineer

Develop and integrate middleware or service layers to enforce permission levels for shared projects.
*   Before serving project data or allowing write operations, verify the requesting user's `permission_level` for the specific `project_id`.
*   Restrict read/write access to project content, AI memory interactions, and configuration based on defined permission levels (e.g., 'view_only' users cannot perform write operations).
*   Apply this logic across all relevant backend services and API endpoints.
