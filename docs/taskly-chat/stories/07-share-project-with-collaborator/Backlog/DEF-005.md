title: Define Sharing Scope and Permission Levels
responsibleArea: Product Manager
---
Clarify the scope of what can be shared (e.g., entire projects, individual conversation threads). Define granular permission levels for collaborators:
*   **View Only**: Can read project content and AI context but cannot modify.
*   **Editor**: Can read and modify project content and interact with AI context, affecting shared memory.
*   **Admin/Manager**: Can edit content, manage other collaborators' permissions, and potentially delete the shared project.
