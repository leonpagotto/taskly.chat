title: Comprehensive Testing of Project Sharing Feature
responsibleArea: Quality Assurance Engineer
---
Develop and execute a thorough test plan for the project sharing functionality.
*   **Functional Testing**: Verify sharing initiation, collaborator search, permission assignment, and revocation.
*   **Access Control Testing**: Test different user roles (owner, editor, viewer, non-collaborator) and verify correct access to shared projects and features (read, write, manage).
*   **AI Context Consistency**: Validate that AI memory and conversational context are consistent and up-to-date for all collaborators in a shared project.
*   **Notification Testing**: Verify delivery and functionality of in-app and email notifications/invitations.
*   **Edge Cases**: Test sharing with non-existent users, self-sharing, and attempting to share with maximum collaborators.
*   **Security Testing**: Ensure only authorized users can share and manage project access.
