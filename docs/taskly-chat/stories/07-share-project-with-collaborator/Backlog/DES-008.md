Design the user interface and interaction flow for initiating project sharing.
*   **Sharing Entry Point**: How does a user trigger the sharing process from a project or conversation view?
*   **Collaborator Selection**: UI for searching and adding collaborators (e.g., by email, username).
*   **Permission Assignment**: UI for selecting permission levels for each collaborator.
*   **Invitation/Notification**: Design how collaborators are informed about being invited to a project.
*   **Manage Access**: UI for project owners to view, modify, or revoke collaborator access.
