title: Develop Frontend Chat Interface for Natural Language Input
status: InProgress
responsibleArea: Full-stack Software Engineer

Implement the interactive chat component on the web client (React) that allows users to type and submit natural language queries.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Input field supports multiline entry and submit via Enter.
- Displays user messages and assistant responses in chronological order.
- Shows a transient loading indicator while awaiting backend response.
- Error states rendered with retry option.
- Mobile responsive (basic stack layout).

Notes:
Initial prototype exists (`ChatShell`). This task upgrades it toward production readiness (structure, state separation, error boundaries).
