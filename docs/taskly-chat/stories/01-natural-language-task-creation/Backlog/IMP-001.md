Create a Node.js/Python API endpoint that securely receives the user's natural language input from the frontend. This endpoint will:
*   Orchestrate the processing of the natural language input.
*   Call AI/ML services for intent recognition and entity extraction.
*   Forward processed structured data to task/reminder/idea creation services.
*   Return AI-generated natural language responses to the frontend.
