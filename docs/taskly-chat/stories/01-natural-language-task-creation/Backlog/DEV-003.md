responsibleArea: AI/Machine Learning Engineer

Implement the logic for Taskly.chat to generate natural language responses back to the user based on the outcome of their request. This involves:
*   **Confirmation Responses**: e.g., "Okay, I've created a task: 'Call John about project updates' due tomorrow."
*   **Clarification Requests**: e.g., "I couldn't quite catch the due date for that task. Could you please specify?"
*   **Error Messages**: e.g., "I'm sorry, I couldn't process that request. Please try again." ensuring they are helpful and conversational.
