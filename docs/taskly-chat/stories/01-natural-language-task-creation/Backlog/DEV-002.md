title: Develop NLP Model for Intent Recognition and Entity Extraction
responsibleArea: AI/Machine Learning Engineer
---
Design, train, and integrate an NLP model (leveraging libraries like LangChain, Hugging Face, or OpenAI API) capable of understanding user intent and extracting relevant entities from natural language input. This involves:
*   **Intent Recognition**: Identifying if the user wants to 'create a task', 'set a reminder', or 'outline an idea'.
*   **Entity Extraction**: Accurately extracting key details such as: 
    *   For tasks: description, priority, due date, assignees.
    *   For reminders: description, specific time/date, recurrence patterns.
    *   For ideas: content, associated project/topic.
*   Developing strategies to handle ambiguous or incomplete requests by identifying missing essential information.
