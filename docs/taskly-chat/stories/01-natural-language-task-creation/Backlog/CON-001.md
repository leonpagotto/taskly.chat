responsibleArea: Quality Assurance Engineer
---
Develop and execute a comprehensive test plan to ensure the 'Natural Language Task Creation' feature functions as expected across all layers of the application. This will involve:
*   Testing a wide variety of natural language inputs (simple, complex, ambiguous).
*   Verifying the accuracy of intent recognition and entity extraction.
*   Confirming the correct persistence of tasks, reminders, and ideas in the database.
*   Validating the frontend display of Taskly.chat's responses, including confirmations and clarifications.
*   Testing error handling and clarification flows for user experience.
*   Conducting performance testing to ensure acceptable response times.
