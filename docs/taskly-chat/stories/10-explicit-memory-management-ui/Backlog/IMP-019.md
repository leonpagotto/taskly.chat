Develop a secure backend API endpoint to allow authenticated users to update specific pieces of their personal memory data.
*   Endpoint: `PUT /api/v1/memories/{memoryId}` (or similar).
*   Authentication: OAuth2.0 integration.
*   Data Validation: Ensure incoming data for updates is valid and matches expected schema.
*   Database Update: Update relevant fields in PostgreSQL and trigger necessary updates in Pinecone/Weaviate (e.g., re-embedding if content changes).
*   Concurrency Control: Handle potential concurrent update requests.
