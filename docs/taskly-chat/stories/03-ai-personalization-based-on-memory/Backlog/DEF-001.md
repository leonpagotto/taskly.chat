Define the data model for storing user routines, preferences, priorities, and important dates. This includes:
- Identifying key entities and attributes for each memory type (e.g., `routine_name`, `time`, `frequency`; `preference_type`, `value`; `priority_item`, `due_date`; `event_name`, `date`).
- Mapping how these structured memories will be stored in PostgreSQL.
- Defining how conversational context/semantic memory will be processed and embedded for storage in a vector database (Pinecone/Weaviate).
- Outlining the NLP techniques for extracting this information from user utterances.
