title: Develop end-to-end tests for AI personalization based on memory
responsibleArea: Quality Assurance Engineer
---
Create end-to-end scenarios to validate that the AI's responses are genuinely personalized and relevant due to the integrated memory system. This involves:
- Defining test cases that establish a user's routine, preference, or priority in one interaction.
- Subsequent interactions where the AI should leverage this remembered information for a personalized response.
- Automating checks for keywords, contextual accuracy, and absence of generic responses where personalization is expected.
