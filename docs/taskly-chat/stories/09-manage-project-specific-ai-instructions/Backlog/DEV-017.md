responsibleArea: Full-stack Software Engineer

Implement the user interface components in React (or React Native for mobile) to allow users to manage project-specific AI instructions, integrating with the developed backend API.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A dedicated 'AI Instructions' component is implemented within the project settings/details page based on the UX/UI design.
    *   Users can input, view, and save markdown-formatted instructions using a text area or rich text editor.
    *   The frontend successfully calls the respective backend API endpoints (`POST`, `GET`, `DELETE`) to manage instructions.
    *   Loading states, error messages, and success notifications are displayed appropriately to the user.
    *   The UI is responsive and provides a consistent experience across different devices (web/mobile, if applicable).
