responsibleArea: Full-stack Software Engineer

Design and implement the necessary database schema changes to store project-specific AI instructions. This will involve creating a new table or modifying an existing one to link instructions directly to individual projects.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A new database table `project_ai_instructions` is created, linking to the `projects` table via a `project_id` foreign key.
    *   The table includes columns for `instruction_id` (primary key), `project_id`, `instruction_text` (TEXT/VARCHAR with support for markdown), `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
    *   Appropriate indexes are added to `project_id` for efficient lookups.
    *   Database migrations are prepared for deployment.
