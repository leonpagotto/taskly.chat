title: Conduct End-to-End Testing for Project AI Instructions Feature
responsibleArea: Quality Assurance Engineer
---
Develop and execute a comprehensive test plan to ensure the entire feature, from user input in the UI to the AI's tailored output, functions correctly, reliably, and securely.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Test cases cover the full CRUD lifecycle of project instructions via the UI (create, read, update, delete) and verify data persistence.
    *   Verification that the AI's output correctly adheres to various project instructions (e.g., 'Draft in bullet points', 'Summarize to 50 words', 'Use a professional tone').
    *   API endpoints are tested for functionality, security vulnerabilities (e.g., unauthorized access, injection), and error handling.
    *   Performance testing is conducted to ensure the feature does not introduce significant latency in AI responses or UI interactions.
    *   Cross-browser and accessibility testing are performed for the new UI components.
