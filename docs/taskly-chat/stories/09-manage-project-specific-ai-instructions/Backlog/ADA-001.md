title: Adapt AI Models to Adhere to Project-Specific Instructions
responsibleArea: AI/Machine Learning Engineer
---
Ensure the underlying natural language processing (NLP) models and generation logic effectively interpret and apply the project-specific instructions during the output generation phase.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   AI-generated output for a project demonstrably follows the specific instructions provided (e.g., uses bullet points if instructed, maintains a specific tone, focuses on certain aspects).
    *   The integration of instructions does not significantly degrade AI model performance or increase response latency.
    *   Mechanisms are in place to prioritize instructions or handle potential conflicts between multiple instructions gracefully.
    *   Metrics are gathered to monitor the AI's adherence to instructions.
