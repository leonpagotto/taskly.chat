    *   The design includes an input field that clearly indicates support for markdown formatting.
    *   User flows for adding new instructions, editing existing ones, and deleting instructions are clearly defined and optimized for usability.
    *   The UI/UX aligns with existing Taskly.chat design system and interaction patterns.
    *   Consideration is given to providing example instructions or helpful tips.
