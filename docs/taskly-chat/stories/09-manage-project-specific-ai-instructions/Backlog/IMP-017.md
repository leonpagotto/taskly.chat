title: Implement Retrieval of Project AI Instructions for AI Model Context
responsibleArea: AI/Machine Learning Engineer
---
Modify the AI service to dynamically retrieve and incorporate project-specific AI instructions when processing any request that originates from or is relevant to a particular project.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The AI service successfully calls the backend API (`GET /api/projects/{projectId}/ai-instructions`) to fetch the relevant instructions when a project context is detected.
    *   The retrieved instructions are correctly formatted and appended to the AI model's prompt or context window for subsequent processing.
    *   Robust error handling is implemented for cases where instructions cannot be retrieved or are malformed.
