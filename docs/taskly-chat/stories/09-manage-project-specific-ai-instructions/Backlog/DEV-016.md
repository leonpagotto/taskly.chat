responsibleArea: Full-stack Software Engineer

Create a set of secure RESTful API endpoints to enable Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for project-specific AI instructions.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/ai-instructions`: Endpoint to create or update instructions for a specific project. It should accept markdown-formatted text.
    *   `GET /api/projects/{projectId}/ai-instructions`: Endpoint to retrieve the instructions for a specific project.
    *   `DELETE /api/projects/{projectId}/ai-instructions`: Endpoint to remove instructions from a specific project.
    *   All endpoints implement robust authentication and authorization checks to ensure only authorized users can manage instructions.
    *   Input validation is implemented to prevent malicious or malformed instruction text.
