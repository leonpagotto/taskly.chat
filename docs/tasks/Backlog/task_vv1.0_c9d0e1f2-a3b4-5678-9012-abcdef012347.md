responsibleArea: QA Engineer

Create a comprehensive test plan for the 'Break Down Projects with Subtasks' feature:
*   Test cases: Define detailed steps for creating a parent task, adding multiple subtasks, editing subtask details, marking subtasks as complete, deleting subtasks, and handling edge cases.
*   Scenario coverage: Include tests for user authentication, error handling (e.g., invalid input), and data persistence across sessions.
*   Acceptance criteria validation: Ensure the feature meets the user story's requirements.
