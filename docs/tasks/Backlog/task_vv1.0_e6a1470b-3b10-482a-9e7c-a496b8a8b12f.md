responsibleArea: UI/UX Designer
---
Design the user interface and experience for presenting suggestions to structure unstructured notes.
*   Create wireframes and mockups for the input area for unstructured notes.
*   Design how suggestions for tasks/subtasks will be displayed to the user (e.g., inline, dedicated suggestion panel, modal).
*   Design interaction patterns for users to review, accept, edit, or dismiss individual suggestions or groups of suggestions.
*   Ensure the design is 'gentle' and non-intrusive.
