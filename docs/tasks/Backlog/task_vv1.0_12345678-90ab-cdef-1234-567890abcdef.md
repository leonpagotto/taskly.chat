Implement the designed filter UI component in React with TypeScript. This component should allow users to switch between 'All', 'Personal', and 'Professional' task views.

### Acceptance Criteria:
*   A reusable React component for task filtering must be developed.
*   The component must visually represent the 'All', 'Personal', and 'Professional' filter states.
*   User interaction (e.g., click) on a filter option should trigger an event with the selected context.
