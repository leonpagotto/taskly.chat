responsibleArea: Full-Stack Developer

Build the React/TypeScript UI component to display the suggestions received from the backend. This component should:
*   Render the list of suggested sub-tasks.
*   Provide interactive elements for users to:
    *   Accept individual suggestions (which creates a new sub-task).
    *   Accept all suggestions.
    *   Dismiss the suggestions panel.
*   Be visually consistent with the designs provided by the UI/UX Designer.
