responsibleArea: Full-Stack Developer

Integrate the Google Calendar API operations with Taskly.chat's internal task management system. This involves triggering calendar updates whenever a relevant task action occurs.
*   Hook into task creation events to create a corresponding Google Calendar event if the user is connected.
*   Hook into task update events (e.g., due date change, title, description, completion status) to update the corresponding Google Calendar event.
*   Hook into task deletion events to remove the event from Google Calendar.
*   Implement logic to handle scenarios where a task might be modified before a calendar connection is established or after it is disconnected.
