Create the API route within the Node.js/Express.js application that exposes the task breakdown suggestion service. This involves:
*   Setting up the HTTP POST endpoint as defined in the API contract.
*   Parsing the incoming request body (task details).
*   Calling the implemented backend suggestion logic.
*   Formatting and returning the suggestions in the defined JSON response.
