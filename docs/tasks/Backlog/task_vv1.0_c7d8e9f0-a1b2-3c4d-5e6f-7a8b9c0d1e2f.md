responsibleArea: UI/UX Designer
---
Design the user interface elements for selecting a task priority (e.g., dropdown, radio buttons, or a segmented control) within the task creation and editing forms. Also, design how the priority level will be visually represented on the task list and individual task detail views (e.g., color-coding, icons, or text labels).

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Wireframes/mockups for priority input in task forms are created.
    *   Wireframes/mockups for priority display in task lists and details are created.
    *   Design considers consistency with the overall app aesthetic.
