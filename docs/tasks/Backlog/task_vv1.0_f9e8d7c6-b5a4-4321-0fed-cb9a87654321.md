responsibleArea: Full-Stack Developer

Develop the frontend components and logic in React with TypeScript to allow users to connect their Google Calendar, based on the approved UI/UX design.
*   Create a 'Connect Google Calendar' button or section within the user settings.
*   Implement an API call to the backend's OAuth initiation endpoint upon user interaction.
*   Handle the redirect to Google's authentication page and process the callback.
*   Update the UI to display the connection status (e.g., 'Connected to Google Calendar', 'Connect Now', 'Error').
*   Display appropriate error messages to the user if the connection fails.
