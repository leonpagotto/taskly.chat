responsibleArea: QA Engineer
---
Create a comprehensive test plan and implement automated tests to ensure the urgent task identification feature functions correctly and reliably.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Develop a detailed test plan outlining various test scenarios for the feature.
    *   Implement unit and integration tests for the backend API logic, focusing on date comparison, filtering, and user-specific task retrieval.
    *   Implement frontend component tests to verify the correct rendering and styling of overdue and approaching tasks based on the provided data.
    *   Create end-to-end (E2E) test cases to simulate user actions, such as creating tasks with different due dates, marking tasks complete, and verifying their appearance/disappearance from the urgent tasks list.
    *   Include test cases for edge scenarios, such as an empty task list, all tasks being overdue, all tasks approaching, and tasks with missing/null due dates.
