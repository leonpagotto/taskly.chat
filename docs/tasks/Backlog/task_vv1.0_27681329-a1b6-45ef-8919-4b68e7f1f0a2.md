title: Integrate task edit UI with backend update API
responsibleArea: Full-Stack Developer
---
Connect the frontend task editing component to the backend API endpoint for updating tasks. This involves:
*   Sending a PUT or PATCH request to /api/tasks/{id} with the updated data upon user submission.
*   Handling API responses, including success messages and displaying user-friendly error messages for failures.
*   Updating the local state or re-fetching task data to reflect changes in the UI after a successful update.
