Develop a React component (form or modal) for editing existing projects. This component should:
*   Pre-populate input fields with the current project's `title` and `description`.
*   Implement client-side validation.
*   Call the `PATCH /api/projects/:id` endpoint to update the project.
*   Provide visual feedback for success/failure.
