responsibleArea: Full-Stack Developer
---
Develop the Node.js/Express.js backend logic to handle the quick capture API endpoint. This task includes:
*   Creating the Express route handler for the defined API endpoint.
*   Extracting text content from the request body.
*   Performing basic server-side validation (e.g., ensuring text is present).
*   Interacting with the PostgreSQL database to save the captured item.
*   Ensuring JWT authentication is applied to the endpoint.
*   Returning appropriate HTTP responses (201 Created on success, 400 Bad Request on validation failure, 401 Unauthorized for auth issues).
