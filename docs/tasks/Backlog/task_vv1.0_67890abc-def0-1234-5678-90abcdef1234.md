Create wireframes and high-fidelity mockups for a new dashboard widget or section dedicated to displaying overdue and approaching tasks.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Propose visual styling (colors, icons, typography) that effectively differentiates task urgency (e.g., distinct colors for overdue vs. approaching).
    *   Define the layout and information hierarchy within the widget, including what task details (title, due date, etc.) should be prominently displayed.
    *   Ensure the design is consistent with the overall Taskly.chat aesthetic and user experience guidelines.
    *   Provide detailed design specifications (e.g., Figma files, style guides) for the development team.
