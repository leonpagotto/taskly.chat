title: 'Develop Backend API for Deleting Projects (DELETE /projects/:id)'
responsibleArea: Full-Stack Developer
---
Implement a RESTful API endpoint (`DELETE /api/projects/:id`) to delete an existing project. This involves:
*   Validating the project `id` parameter.
*   Ensuring the authenticated user owns the project to be deleted.
*   Deleting the project from the database. Consider soft deletion or cascading delete implications for associated tasks (simple delete for MVP).
