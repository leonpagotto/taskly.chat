responsibleArea: Product Manager
---
Define specific requirements and acceptance criteria for how the 'gentle prompts or suggestions' should function.
*   What types of unstructured input should the system prioritize for parsing (e.g., short sentences, bulleted lists, longer paragraphs)?
*   What constitutes an 'actionable task' from unstructured text?
*   What is the desired accuracy level for suggestions in the MVP?
*   What level of user control is needed over generated suggestions (e.g., accept all, accept individually, edit before accepting)?
