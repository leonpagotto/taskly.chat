Conduct a thorough technical review of the database schema changes, backend API modifications, and frontend implementation related to task filtering. This ensures adherence to architectural standards, performance, security, and maintainability.

### Acceptance Criteria:
*   All relevant code (database migration, backend endpoints, frontend components) has been reviewed for code quality and adherence to best practices.
*   Performance implications of filtering queries have been considered and optimized if necessary.
*   Security concerns (e.g., SQL injection, unauthorized access to filtered data) have been addressed.
*   Documentation (if any) is updated to reflect new API parameters and schema changes.
