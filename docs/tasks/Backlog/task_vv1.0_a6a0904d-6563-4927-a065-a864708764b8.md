Develop a reusable React component (e.g., a modal or a form) in TypeScript for editing existing task details. This component should:
*   Be capable of receiving task data and pre-filling its input fields for title, description, due_date, and priority.
*   Provide an intuitive user interface for modifying these details, including a date picker for due_date and a dropdown/selector for priority.
*   Include client-side validation for input fields.
*   Feature 'Save' and 'Cancel' actions.
