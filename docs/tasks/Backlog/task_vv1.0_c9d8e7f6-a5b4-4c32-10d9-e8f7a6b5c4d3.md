responsibleArea: Full-Stack Developer
---
Implement a RESTful API endpoint (`POST /api/projects`) to allow authenticated users to create new projects. This involves:
*   Request validation for `title` (required, min/max length) and `description`.
*   Associating the project with the authenticated user's ID.
*   Persisting the new project to the PostgreSQL database.
*   Returning the newly created project object upon success.
