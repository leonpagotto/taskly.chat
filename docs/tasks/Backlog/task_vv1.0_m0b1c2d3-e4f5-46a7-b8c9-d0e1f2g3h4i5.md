Develop comprehensive integration tests for all project-related backend API endpoints (`POST`, `GET`, `PUT/PATCH`, `DELETE`). Tests should cover:
*   Successful creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of projects.
*   Authentication and authorization scenarios (e.g., non-authenticated access, unauthorized access to another user's project).
*   Input validation failures.
*   Edge cases.
