title: Implement Frontend Unit and Integration Tests for Item Categorization
responsibleArea: Full-Stack Developer
---
Write unit and integration tests for the React categorization component and its integration with the backend API. These tests should cover rendering, user interaction, and state updates.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Tests confirm the categorization component renders correctly with appropriate options.
    *   Tests simulate user selection of categories and verify component behavior.
    *   Tests mock API calls and assert correct frontend state updates (e.g., loading, success, error).
    *   Tests ensure that the UI displays the correct category after an update.
