Develop automated tests for the backend quick capture functionality. This includes:
*   **Unit Tests:** For the service layer logic, validating data saving and validation rules.
*   **Integration Tests:** For the API endpoint, ensuring it correctly handles requests, interacts with the database, and applies authentication.
*   Use of test doubles where appropriate (e.g., mocking database calls in unit tests).
