Develop a React component to display a list of projects fetched from the backend API. This component should:
*   Display project titles and descriptions.
*   Provide buttons/links for 'View', 'Edit', and 'Delete' for each project.
*   Include a button to open the 'Create New Project' form/modal.
*   Handle loading states and errors gracefully.
