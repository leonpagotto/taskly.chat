Develop and execute comprehensive end-to-end test cases for the "View Progress Summary" feature.
*   Test cases cover both daily and weekly summary views.
*   Verify correct display of completed and pending task counts for various scenarios (e.g., no tasks, all tasks completed, mixed tasks).
*   Test authentication and authorization to ensure a user can only see their own summary.
*   Test edge cases, such as periods with no tasks or periods spanning month/year boundaries.
*   Document any identified bugs and work with developers for resolution.
