responsibleArea: Full-Stack Developer

Develop the Node.js/Express.js backend logic responsible for analyzing a given task's title and description to generate basic breakdown suggestions. This will initially use simple heuristics:
*   Keyword detection (e.g., 'plan', 'research', 'setup', 'implement', 'deploy').
*   Sentence splitting or phrase extraction for long descriptions.
*   Rule-based logic to suggest common preceding or succeeding actions.
