responsibleArea: UI/UX Designer

Create wireframes and high-fidelity mockups for how task breakdown suggestions will be presented to the user. This includes:
*   **Placement:** Where the suggestions appear in the task creation/editing flow.
*   **Visual Cues:** How to highlight that suggestions are available.
*   **Interaction Patterns:** How users can accept individual suggestions (e.g., 'Add as sub-task'), accept all, or dismiss the suggestions.
*   **Responsiveness:** Design for different screen sizes.
