Design the user interface and user experience for the 'Quick Capture Idea/Task' feature. This includes:
*   Wireframes and mockups for the input field.
*   Placement of the input field (e.g., persistent header element, dedicated page).
*   Consideration for mobile and desktop responsiveness.
*   Focus on simplicity and ease of use for basic text entry only.
