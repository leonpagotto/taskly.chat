Design and document the RESTful API endpoint for task breakdown suggestions. This includes:
*   **Endpoint:** e.g., `/api/tasks/suggest-breakdown`
*   **Request Payload:** Task details (e.g., `title: string`, `description: string`)
*   **Response Format:** An array of suggested sub-task titles (e.g., `['step 1', 'step 2']`)
*   **Error Handling:** Define standard error responses.
