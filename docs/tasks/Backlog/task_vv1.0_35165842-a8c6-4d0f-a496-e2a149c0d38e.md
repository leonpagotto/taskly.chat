title: Write Backend Unit and Integration Tests for Task Completion API
responsibleArea: Full-Stack Developer
---
Create unit tests for the task completion service logic and integration tests for the `PATCH /api/tasks/{id}` endpoint.
*   Cover success cases (task marked complete, task marked marked incomplete).
*   Cover edge cases (invalid `id`, unauthorized access).
*   Ensure database interactions are mocked or cleaned up appropriately.
