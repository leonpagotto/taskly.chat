title: Integrate Frontend Categorization with Backend API and State Management
responsibleArea: Full-Stack Developer
---
Connect the newly developed frontend categorization component to the backend API endpoint for updating item categories. Implement local state management to ensure the UI immediately reflects category changes.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   On user selection of a category, an API call is triggered to update the backend.
    *   Frontend state (e.g., using Redux, Context API, or component state) is updated upon successful API response.
    *   Loading indicators are shown during API calls, and error messages are displayed for failed updates.
    *   The UI consistently displays the item's current category.
