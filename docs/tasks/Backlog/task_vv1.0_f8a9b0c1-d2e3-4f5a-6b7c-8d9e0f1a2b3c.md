responsibleArea: Full-Stack Developer
---
Develop the React component(s) for displaying the task progress summary on the frontend.
*   Create a dedicated React component (e.g., `ProgressSummaryCard` or `DashboardSummary`).
*   Integrate with the backend API (`Task: Develop Backend API for Task Summary`) to fetch summary data.
*   Display completed and pending task counts as designed by UI/UX.
*   Implement UI controls (e.g., toggle buttons, date pickers) to switch between daily and weekly views.
*   Handle loading states and error conditions gracefully.
*   Ensure the component is responsive and adheres to the designed UI/UX specifications.
