responsibleArea: QA Engineer

Develop a comprehensive test plan and execute test cases to ensure the Google Calendar integration functions correctly and reliably.
*   Test successful connection and disconnection flows.
*   Verify new Taskly.chat tasks with due dates appear in Google Calendar.
*   Verify updates to Taskly.chat tasks (title, description, due date) are reflected in Google Calendar.
*   Verify deleted Taskly.chat tasks are removed from Google Calendar.
*   Test error handling for various scenarios (e.g., API failures, invalid tokens, network issues).
*   Perform tests with different Google accounts and calendar configurations.
*   Test edge cases like tasks with no due date, or tasks with only a date but no time.
