Create wireframes, mockups, and potentially a prototype for:
*   The 'Projects' dashboard or list page, showing all user's projects.
*   A 'Create New Project' form or modal.
*   An 'Edit Project' form or modal.
*   Confirmation dialogs for deleting projects.
*   Define the user flow for navigating between project list and individual project views.
