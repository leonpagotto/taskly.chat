title: Create and Execute End-to-End Test for Categorizing a Captured Item
responsibleArea: QA Engineer
---
Develop and execute an end-to-end test script to verify the complete user flow of categorizing a captured item. This includes creating an item, assigning a category, and verifying persistence and display across the application.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The test successfully creates a new `CapturedItem`.
    *   The test simulates the user selecting a category for the item.
    *   The test verifies that the selected category is correctly displayed in the UI.
    *   The test confirms that the category change is persisted in the database and visible on subsequent page loads/re-renders.
