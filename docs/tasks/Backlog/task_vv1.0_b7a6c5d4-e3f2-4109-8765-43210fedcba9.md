Implement backend services to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on Google Calendar events using the Google Calendar API.
*   Function to create a new event in the user's Google Calendar.
*   Function to update an existing event in Google Calendar (using the stored `task_id` for lookup).
*   Function to delete an event from Google Calendar.
*   Implement robust error handling for API calls, including rate limits and network issues.
*   Ensure access token refreshing logic is in place when the current token expires.
