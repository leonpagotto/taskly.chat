Develop a reusable React component for selecting task priority. Integrate this component into the task creation and editing forms. Ensure it properly sends the selected priority to the backend API when creating or updating a task.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A dedicated `PrioritySelector` React component is created.
    *   This component allows users to choose 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low'.
    *   The selected priority is correctly captured and sent in API requests for task creation/updates.
