title: 'Frontend: Integrate Task and Project Data Fetching'
responsibleArea: Full-Stack Developer
---
Implement data fetching logic within the `UnifiedDashboardView` component in React with TypeScript.
*   Call the `/api/tasks/me` and `/api/projects/me` backend endpoints to retrieve user data.
*   Utilize an HTTP client (e.g., `fetch` or `axios`) to make authenticated API requests using JWT.
*   Handle loading states, error states, and display an empty state message if no tasks or projects are returned.
