title: Develop Backend API for Listing Projects (GET /projects)
responsibleArea: Full-Stack Developer
---
Implement a RESTful API endpoint (`GET /api/projects`) to retrieve a list of projects for the authenticated user. This includes:
*   Filtering projects by the current user's ID.
*   Returning an array of project objects, potentially with pagination support for future scalability (basic list for MVP).
*   Ensuring proper authentication and authorization checks.
