Develop the React/TypeScript frontend component for the quick capture input field. This task involves:
*   Creating a reusable input component.
*   Handling user text input and state management.
*   Triggering the backend API call on submission (e.g., Enter key press or button click).
*   Displaying basic success/error feedback (e.g., clearing the input on success).
*   Ensuring basic styling aligns with the UI/UX design.
