title: Design UI/UX for Captured Item Categorization
responsibleArea: UI/UX Designer
---
Create wireframes and high-fidelity mockups for how users will categorize a captured item. This includes the initial categorization flow upon capture and the ability to modify an existing item's category. Designs should consider desktop and mobile interfaces. A dropdown, radio buttons, or segmented control could be viable options.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Provide clear UI designs for selecting 'idea', 'task', or 'goal'.
    *   Ensure the categorization user flow is intuitive and accessible.
    *   Deliver mockups for both initial categorization and category modification for an existing item.
