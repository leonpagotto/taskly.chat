title: Frontend Component Tests for Subtasks
responsibleArea: Full-Stack Developer
---
Develop automated tests for the React subtask components:
*   Unit tests: Use Jest and React Testing Library to test component rendering, state changes, and user interactions (e.g., clicking 'add subtask' button, marking subtask complete).
*   Mock API calls: Simulate backend responses to isolate component testing from the actual API.
