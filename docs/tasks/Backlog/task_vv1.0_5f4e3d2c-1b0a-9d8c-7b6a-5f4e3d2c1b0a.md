Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for the backend API endpoints related to setting and retrieving task due dates. Acceptance Criteria: - Tests cover successful creation/update of tasks with and without a due date; - Tests validate proper handling of invalid `dueDate` formats (if applicable); - Tests ensure the `dueDate` is correctly stored and retrieved from the database; - All new code paths introduced for due dates are covered by tests.
