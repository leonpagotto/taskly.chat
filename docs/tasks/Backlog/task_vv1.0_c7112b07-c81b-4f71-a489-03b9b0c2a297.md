title: Integrate Frontend with Backend API for Task Completion
responsibleArea: Full-Stack Developer
---
Implement the necessary frontend logic (React/TypeScript) to call the `PATCH /api/tasks/{id}` endpoint when the user interacts with the task completion toggle.
*   Use an asynchronous function to send the request.
*   Handle loading states and potential API errors.
