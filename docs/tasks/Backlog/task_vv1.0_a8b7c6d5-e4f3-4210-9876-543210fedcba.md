responsibleArea: Full-Stack Developer
---
Implement the necessary backend RESTful API endpoints using Node.js/Express.js to handle the Google OAuth 2.0 authorization flow.
*   Create a GET endpoint (`/api/auth/google/calendar/initiate`) to generate and redirect to Google's authentication URL with required scopes.
*   Create a GET endpoint (`/api/auth/google/calendar/callback`) to receive the authorization code from Google, exchange it for access and refresh tokens, and securely store these tokens in the database associated with the user.
*   Utilize the `googleapis` Node.js client library for OAuth interactions.
