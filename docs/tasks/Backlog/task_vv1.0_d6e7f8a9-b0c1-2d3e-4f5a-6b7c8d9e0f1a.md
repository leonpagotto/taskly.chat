Design an intuitive user interface component (e.g., dropdown, radio buttons, or tabs) that allows users to easily select and apply filters based on 'personal' or 'professional' contexts, as well as an 'All' option.

### Acceptance Criteria:

*   The design must clearly present 'All', 'Personal', and 'Professional' as distinct filter options.
*   Ensure the design integrates seamlessly with the existing task list view.
