Implement the logic to fetch and display the due date on task list items and the detailed task view. Acceptance Criteria: - The due date is visible on each task card in a user-friendly format (e.g., "Due Nov 15"); - The detailed task view clearly shows the assigned due date; - Handle cases where no due date is set (display "No due date" or similar).
