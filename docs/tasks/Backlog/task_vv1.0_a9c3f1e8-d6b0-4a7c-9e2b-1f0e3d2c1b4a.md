Define the RESTful API endpoint specification for capturing new ideas/tasks. This includes:
*   HTTP Method (e.g., POST).
*   Endpoint URL (e.g., `/api/v1/capture`).
*   Request body structure (e.g., JSON payload with a single 'text' field).
*   Expected response structure for success and errors.
*   Authentication requirements (JWT).
*   Basic validation rules (e.g., text is not empty).
