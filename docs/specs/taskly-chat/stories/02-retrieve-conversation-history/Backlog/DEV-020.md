# DEV-020 Persistence Package or Schema Placement Decision

Story: 02 Retrieve Conversation History
Status: Completed
Owner: Engineering

## Goal
Decide whether to introduce a new `@taskly/data` package housing Prisma schema & data access or colocate schema at repo root.

## Options
1. New `packages/data` (`@taskly/data`): clear boundary, future reuse.
2. Root-level `prisma/`: simpler initial integration, fewer package build steps.

## Decision Factors
- Build complexity
- Code ownership clarity
- Future scaling (migrations, cross-service use)

## Acceptance Criteria
- One option selected and documented in SPEC-001 appendix
- Directory scaffolded accordingly

## Decision
Proceed with Option 1: create `packages/data` (`@taskly/data`). Rationale: clear encapsulation of persistence concerns, scalable toward future services, minimal added complexity vs root schema. Root remains cleaner for app + infra scripts.
