# TES-011 Task Draft Extraction Tests

Story: 01 Natural Language Task Creation
Status: Proposed
Priority: Medium
Owner: Engineering
Tags: testing, extraction

## Purpose
Add focused tests for task draft extraction logic ensuring consistent translation from parse artifacts into `TaskDraft`.

## Scope
- Happy path extraction from clear create-intent input
- Handling missing title (should remain undefined)
- Ensuring due date or priority absence gracefully handled
- Multiple sequential user inputs producing independent drafts
- Validate no shared mutable state between extractions

## Acceptance Criteria
- Tests in `packages/ai/__tests__/taskExtraction.spec.ts`
- Cover scenarios where parsing returns partial data
- Verify output conforms to `TaskDraft` type shape
- Include at least one regression test capturing previously mis-parsed phrase (to be documented in test comment)

## Out of Scope
End-to-end API and UI rendering tests.

## Risks / Notes
Logic is heuristic; keep assertions on structure not verbose natural language fragments.

## Completion Criteria
PR merged, tests passing in CI.
