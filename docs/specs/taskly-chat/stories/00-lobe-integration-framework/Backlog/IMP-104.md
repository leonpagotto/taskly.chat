# IMP-104 Enforce Import Boundary (Lint Rule)

Story: 00 Lobe Integration Framework
Status: Proposed
Owner: Engineering

## Goal
Prevent cross-package deep relative imports (e.g., `../../core/src/...`) to ensure public API boundaries and maintainable module graph.

## Approach
Add custom ESLint rule or pattern restriction disallowing imports that:
- Traverse upward out of a package and into another package's `src` directory.

Allow listed exceptions (none initially).

## Acceptance Criteria
- ESLint fails on any import matching regex pattern of forbidden form
- Documented in ARCHITECTURE.md module resolution section
- Existing codebase passes (no violations at introduction)
