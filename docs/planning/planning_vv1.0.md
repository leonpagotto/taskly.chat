# Plan

## Architecture
Taskly.chat will be built upon a robust client-server architecture. The frontend will be a single-page application (SPA) acting as the primary user interface, responsible for capturing user input, displaying information, and managing user interactions. This client will communicate with a centralized backend service via a RESTful API. The backend will handle all core business logic, including user authentication, task and project management (CRUD operations for ideas, tasks, goals, and projects), basic intelligent assistance processing, and managing integrations with external services. A persistent database will store all user data, task details, and configuration settings. An integration layer within the backend will facilitate secure communication with selected third-party APIs (e.g., calendar services) to synchronize information and extend functionality.

## Tech Stack
For the MVP, we recommend a modern and efficient tech stack to ensure rapid development and maintainability. The frontend will be developed using React with TypeScript, providing a highly interactive and scalable user experience. On the backend, Node.js with the Express.js framework and TypeScript will be used to build a robust and performant RESTful API. PostgreSQL is selected as the relational database for its reliability, data integrity, and flexibility for structured task management data. Docker will be utilized for containerization, ensuring consistent deployment environments across development, testing, and production. Deployment will target a cloud platform (e.g., AWS or Google Cloud) leveraging services like EC2/ECS or Cloud Run for scalable and managed hosting. User authentication will be handled securely using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

## Non-Functional Requirements
1.  **Usability:** The application must embody a human-centered design, providing an intuitive, effortless, and clear user experience for capturing, structuring, and managing tasks.2.  **Performance:** Core actions such as capturing a new task, loading the dashboard, and updating task statuses must respond quickly (e.g., sub-second response times for critical operations) to ensure a fluid user workflow.3.  **Reliability & Availability:** The system must be highly available for core task management functionalities, minimizing downtime to ensure users can access their tasks when needed.4.  **Security:** User data, including personal tasks and credentials, must be protected with industry-standard security measures, including secure authentication (e.g., JWT), data encryption at rest and in transit, and robust API security for integrations.5.  **Maintainability:** The codebase will be clean, well-documented, and follow established coding standards to facilitate future enhancements, bug fixes, and feature expansions.6.  **Integrability:** The architecture will be designed with a clear API to allow for future expansion of external tool integrations beyond the initial MVP scope.7.  **Scalability (MVP-focused):** While focusing on MVP, the architecture should be capable of supporting a growing number of individual users and their tasks without significant re-architecture.8.  **Data Integrity:** All task and project data must be consistently stored and retrieved, ensuring no data loss or corruption during operations.
