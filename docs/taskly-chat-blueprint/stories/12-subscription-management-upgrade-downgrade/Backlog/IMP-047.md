Develop the interactive frontend flows for users to upgrade or downgrade their subscriptions:
-   Integrate with backend API endpoints for upgrade/downgrade actions.
-   Implement Stripe Elements or similar UI components for secure payment input during upgrades.
-   Clearly present available tiers and their benefits/costs.
-   For downgrades, display clear warnings about potential feature loss or data implications before confirmation.
-   Handle loading states and error messages during API calls.
