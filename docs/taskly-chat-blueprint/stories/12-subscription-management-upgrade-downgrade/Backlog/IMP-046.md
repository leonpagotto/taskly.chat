responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Develop a robust webhook handler to process asynchronous events from the payment gateway (e.g., Stripe). This includes:
-   Receiving and verifying webhook events (e.g., `invoice.paid`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`).
-   Updating the user's subscription status, billing history, and entitlements in the PostgreSQL database based on these events.
-   Handling potential errors and retries for webhook processing.
-   Ensuring secure endpoint for webhooks.
