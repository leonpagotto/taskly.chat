Implement the backend logic to dynamically manage and enforce user feature access and AI credit limits based on their active subscription tier. This includes:
-   A service or module that can check a user's current tier and associated permissions/limits.
-   Logic to grant immediate access to new features upon successful upgrade.
-   Logic to revoke access or adjust limits for features upon downgrade.
-   Integration with the AI/ML services to enforce AI credit consumption.
