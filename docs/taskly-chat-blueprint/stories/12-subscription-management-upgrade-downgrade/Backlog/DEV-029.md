Create a suite of RESTful API endpoints on the NestJS backend to manage user subscriptions. This includes:
-   `GET /subscriptions/me`: Retrieve current user subscription status, tier, features, limits, and next billing date.
-   `GET /subscriptions/history`: Retrieve detailed billing and subscription change history.
-   `POST /subscriptions/upgrade`: Initiate the upgrade process, handling tier changes and payment processing.
-   `POST /subscriptions/downgrade`: Handle the downgrade process, including validating feature loss implications.
-   Internal logic for tracking and updating AI credits and feature entitlements based on tier.
