title: Subscription Management & Upgrade/Downgrade
priority: Highest
---
As a user, I want a clear and intuitive interface to manage my subscription, including options to upgrade to a higher tier (e.g., from Free to Cheap AI, or Cheap AI to Pro) or downgrade to a lower tier, so I can adapt my plan to my evolving needs. This includes viewing my current subscription status, billing history, next billing date, and remaining AI credits or feature limits. The upgrade process should be seamless, immediately granting access to new features upon successful payment. The downgrade process should clearly communicate any loss of features or data implications. The system must integrate securely with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) to handle transactions, prorated charges, and recurring billing, adhering to PCI DSS compliance and other financial security standards. Clear notifications and confirmations should be provided for all subscription changes. This feature is critical for the flexible monetization strategy, ensuring a smooth user journey through the different tiers and maximizing customer lifetime value. All subscription and payment-related data must be handled with the utmost security and privacy, in compliance with standard required data privacy and security measures.
