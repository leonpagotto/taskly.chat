title: Develop Slack API Client and Message Handling
responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Create a robust internal client library or service for interacting with the Slack API. This client should:
- Abstract Slack API calls (e.g., sending messages, fetching channel lists, listening to events).
- Implement error handling, retries, and rate limiting specific to Slack's API.
- Integrate with Slack's Event API and/or Webhooks to receive real-time updates (new messages, channel events) from configured Slack workspaces.
- Validate and sanitize all incoming Slack data.
