title: Integrate UI Elements for Sending Content to Slack
responsibleArea: Frontend Developer (Web & Desktop)
---
Add user interface elements within Taskly.chat that allow users to explicitly send content (e.g., tasks, reminders, summaries) to Slack. This involves:
- 'Send to Slack' options on relevant Taskly.chat items (tasks, memory entries, conversation summaries).
- A modal or dropdown for selecting the target Slack channel or direct message.
- Confirmation messages upon successful sending.
- Integration with backend APIs for dispatching the content.
