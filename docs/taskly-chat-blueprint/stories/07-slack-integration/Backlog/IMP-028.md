Build the user interface allowing users to configure which Slack channels or direct messages Taskly.chat can interact with. This includes:
- A list of available channels and DMs from the connected Slack workspace.
- Checkboxes or toggles for users to select/deselect interaction permissions.
- A mechanism to save and update these preferences, ensuring they are sent to the backend.
- Clear visual indicators of currently configured channels.
