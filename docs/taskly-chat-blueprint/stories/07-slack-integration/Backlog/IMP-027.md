responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Develop the backend services responsible for processing incoming Slack messages and converting them into Taskly.chat tasks or memory entries. This involves:
- Receiving parsed Slack message content from the Slack API client.
- Identifying specific commands or conversational prompts within Slack messages (e.g., 'convert to task', 'remember this').
- Initial parsing and extraction of relevant information (e.g., task title, description, due date) from Slack messages.
- Storing the extracted information as new tasks or memory entries in Taskly.chat's database.
