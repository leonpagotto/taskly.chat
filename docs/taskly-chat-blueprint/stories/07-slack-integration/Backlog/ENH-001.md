Refine the natural language understanding capabilities to accurately extract and structure information from Slack messages for task or memory creation. This includes:
- Developing or fine-tuning models/rules to identify task attributes (e.g., action, assignee, due date) and key memory elements from conversational text.
- Handling variations in user phrasing and context within Slack conversations.
- Defining robust conversational prompts and commands that trigger specific Taskly.chat actions when used in Slack messages.
