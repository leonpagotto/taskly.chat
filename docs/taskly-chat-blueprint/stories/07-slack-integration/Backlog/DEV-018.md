responsibleArea: QA Engineer

Create a detailed test plan for the entire Slack integration feature, covering:
- Functional tests (OAuth, sending/receiving messages, task/memory creation from Slack).
- Integration tests (end-to-end flow between Taskly.chat and Slack).
- Security tests (token handling, data privacy compliance, authorization).
- Performance and reliability tests (API rate limiting, error handling).
- Usability tests for the configuration UI.
- Edge case scenarios (disconnected accounts, API errors).
