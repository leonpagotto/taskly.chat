Develop and implement the secure OAuth 2.0 authentication flow to allow users to connect their Slack workspace with Taskly.chat. This includes:
- Backend endpoints for initiating OAuth (redirect to Slack).
- Callback endpoints to handle Slack's OAuth response, exchange authorization code for access tokens.
- Secure storage of Slack workspace tokens and user identity (e.g., in PostgreSQL).
- Token refreshing mechanism to maintain continuous access.
