Create a comprehensive test plan and execute tests for all aspects of the Trello integration, covering authentication, API interactions, natural language commands, UI functionality, and data synchronization. Ensure adherence to privacy and security requirements.

### Acceptance Criteria:
*   Test cases cover successful Trello OAuth 2.0 authentication and de-authentication.
*   All specified Trello commands (create card, assign, set due date, move card, get updates) are tested via natural language input.
*   Tests verify the correct parsing of NLU intents and entities for Trello actions.
*   UI for enabling/disabling integration and board selection is thoroughly tested.
*   Bidirectional data synchronization (if implemented) is verified, ensuring changes in one platform are reflected in the other.
*   Negative test cases (e.g., invalid commands, Trello API errors) are included.
*   Data privacy and security compliance checks are performed for all Trello data handling.
