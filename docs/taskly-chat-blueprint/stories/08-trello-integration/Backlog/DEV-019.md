Create a dedicated backend service or module responsible for interacting with the Trello API. This service will abstract Trello API calls, providing methods for common actions such as creating cards, assigning members, setting due dates, moving cards, and retrieving board/card details.

### Acceptance Criteria:
*   API endpoints exist to perform core Trello actions: create card, update card (assign member, set due date, move), get card details, get list of boards.
*   The service correctly uses the stored OAuth tokens for Trello API requests.
*   Robust error handling is implemented for Trello API failures (e.g., rate limits, invalid permissions).
*   All interactions with the Trello API are logged for debugging and monitoring (without exposing sensitive data).
