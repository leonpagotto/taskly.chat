*   Users can clearly see the status of their Trello integration (connected/disconnected).
*   A button/link to initiate the Trello OAuth 2.0 authentication process is present.
*   A list of accessible Trello boards is displayed after successful authentication.
*   Users can select/deselect specific boards for Taskly.chat access.
*   Changes to integration status and board selection are saved and reflected immediately.
