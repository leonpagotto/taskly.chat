title: Develop Trello Webhook Listener for Bidirectional Sync
responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Implement a webhook listener to receive updates from Trello, enabling Taskly.chat to efficiently reflect changes made directly in Trello (e.g., a card moved, due date changed). This ensures data consistency across both platforms without constant polling.

### Acceptance Criteria:
*   A secure webhook endpoint is configured to receive Trello notifications.
*   The system can parse and process Trello webhook payloads for relevant events (e.g., card updates, board changes).
*   Received Trello updates are processed to update Taskly.chat's internal representation or memory, reflecting changes made directly in Trello.
