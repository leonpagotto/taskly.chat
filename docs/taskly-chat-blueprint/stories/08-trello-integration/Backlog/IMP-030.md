Develop and implement the secure OAuth 2.0 authentication flow for connecting user Trello accounts. This involves handling redirection, token exchange, and secure storage of access and refresh tokens. Compliance with data privacy and security standards is crucial.

### Acceptance Criteria:
*   User can initiate Trello OAuth 2.0 authentication from Taskly.chat.
*   Taskly.chat successfully obtains and securely stores Trello access and refresh tokens for the authenticated user.
*   The system handles token expiry and refresh mechanisms.
*   All sensitive Trello credentials and tokens are stored encrypted and protected.
*   Error handling is in place for failed authentication attempts.
