title: Develop NLU and Intent Mapping for Trello Commands
responsibleArea: AI/ML Engineer

Enhance the AI's natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities to recognize and interpret user requests related to Trello, such as 'create a card', 'move card', 'assign to', 'set due date', and 'get updates'. Map these intents to specific Trello API actions and extract relevant entities (e.g., card title, list name, member name, due date, board name).

### Acceptance Criteria:
*   The AI can accurately identify Trello-related intents from user natural language input.
*   Key entities (card name, board name, list name, member, due date) are correctly extracted from user queries.
*   A clear mapping exists between identified intents/entities and the corresponding Trello API calls and parameters.
*   The system can handle variations in phrasing for Trello commands.
