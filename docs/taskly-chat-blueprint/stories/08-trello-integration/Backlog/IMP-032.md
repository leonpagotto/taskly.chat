responsibleArea: AI/ML Engineer

Design and implement the conversational logic for Trello interactions, including asking clarifying questions when information is missing (e.g., 'Which board is this for?', 'What should be the card title?'), confirming actions, and providing informative feedback about Trello operations.

### Acceptance Criteria:
*   The AI gracefully prompts the user for missing information required to perform a Trello action.
*   The AI confirms successful Trello operations (e.g., 'Card 'Task X' created in 'To Do' list on 'Project Y' board').
*   The AI provides user-friendly error messages if a Trello operation fails.
*   Conversational context is maintained during multi-turn Trello interactions.
