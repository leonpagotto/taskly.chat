### Acceptance Criteria:
*   Trello-specific messages (e.g., 'Card created', 'Card moved') are displayed clearly in the chat.
*   AI prompts for missing Trello information are presented in an intuitive manner.
*   Visual indicators or links within the chat might be used to reference Trello items (if applicable).
*   The UI handles and displays potential error messages from Trello operations effectively.
