Create RESTful API endpoints using NestJS for the backend to handle the full lifecycle of automation rules.
*   `POST /automations`: Endpoint to create a new automation rule, receiving structured data from NLU processing.
*   `GET /automations`: Endpoint to retrieve a list of all active/paused automations for a specific user.
*   `GET /automations/{id}`: Endpoint to retrieve detailed information of a single automation rule.
*   `PUT /automations/{id}`: Endpoint to update an existing automation rule (e.g., pause, reactivate, modify parameters).
*   `DELETE /automations/{id}`: Endpoint to remove an automation rule.
*   Implement data validation, authentication (JWT), and authorization for all endpoints.
*   Integrate with PostgreSQL for persistent storage of automation rules.
