title: Develop Context-Aware Automation Triggering Logic
responsibleArea: AI/ML Engineer
---
Implement the core logic for automations to leverage local persistent memory to understand user context (e.g., schedule from calendar, project deadlines, user habits, task statuses).
*   Define a mechanism for the AI to securely query and access relevant context data from local persistent memory (client-side IndexedDB/SQLite and potentially synced server data).
*   Develop a rules engine or AI-driven logic to evaluate automation conditions based on real-time and historical context.
*   Implement conditional triggering for nudges (e.g., "if I haven't started by 3 PM") by checking task progress or user activity.
*   Ensure timely and efficient evaluation of trigger conditions to avoid delays in nudges or reminders.
