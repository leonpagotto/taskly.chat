Implement the UI components necessary to receive and display notifications pushed from the backend notification system within the Taskly.chat web and desktop applications.
*   Develop discreet, non-intrusive pop-ups, banners, or system tray notifications as appropriate for each platform (web and desktop).
*   Ensure notifications are persistent until explicitly dismissed by the user or acted upon, preventing missed prompts.
*   Provide clear and actionable information within each notification, including the reminder/nudge message and the originating automation context.
*   Implement optional sound or vibration alerts for notifications, configurable by the user.
*   Ensure consistent notification experience across active web and desktop instances.
