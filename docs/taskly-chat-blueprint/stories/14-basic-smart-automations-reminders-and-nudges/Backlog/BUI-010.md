Create a comprehensive user interface for viewing, creating, editing, pausing, and deleting automation rules across web and desktop platforms.
*   Develop a clear list view of all current automations, displaying their status (active, paused) and key trigger details.
*   Provide intuitive controls for each automation: dedicated "Edit", "Pause/Activate", and "Delete" buttons or actions.
*   Design and implement an intuitive form or wizard for manually editing or creating automation rules, offering an alternative or complement to NLU creation.
*   Ensure the UI clearly and concisely explains "when and why an automation will trigger" through well-designed labels, tooltips, and status indicators, reinforcing user control.
*   Implement responsive design for web and optimize for desktop application experience.
