title: Implement Natural Language Input Component for Automations
responsibleArea: Frontend Developer (Web & Desktop)
---
Develop a dedicated user interface component within the web and desktop applications that allows users to input automation requests using natural language.
*   Create an interactive input field that sends user text to the NLU service (implemented by AI/ML Engineer) for processing.
*   Display a clear confirmation or a structured preview of the automation rule derived from the NLU output before the user commits to saving it.
*   Provide immediate and helpful feedback to the user in cases of NLU parsing errors or ambiguities, guiding them to refine their input.
*   Ensure accessibility and responsiveness for mobile-first web design and desktop applications.
