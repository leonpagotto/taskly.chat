responsibleArea: AI/ML Engineer
---
Develop and integrate natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities to parse user input (e.g., "remind me about this meeting 15 minutes before", "nudge me to finish my report if I haven't started by 3 PM") and extract structured automation rules.
*   Identify key entities: action (remind, nudge), time/duration, event/condition, task/goal.
*   Map extracted entities to a predefined automation rule schema.
*   Handle variations in natural language phrasing and ambiguity.
*   Integrate with the existing Gemini model pipeline for processing.
