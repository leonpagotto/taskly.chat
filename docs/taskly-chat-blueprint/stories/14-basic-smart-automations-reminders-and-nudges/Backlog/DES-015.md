Create intuitive and engaging user experiences for the entire basic smart automations feature.
*   Design wireframes, mockups, and high-fidelity prototypes for the natural language input component, demonstrating the user flow for creating automations via NLU.
*   Design the dedicated automation management interface, including the layout for listing automations, detailed views, and controls for editing, pausing, and deleting.
*   Ensure the design clearly communicates "when and why an automation will trigger" through effective use of language, visual cues, status indicators, and consistent iconography.
*   Design the appearance, behavior, and dismiss patterns for in-app notifications, ensuring they are timely, relevant, and not disruptive.
*   Focus on clarity, intuitiveness, and user control throughout the design process, adhering to the mobile-first principle for web.
