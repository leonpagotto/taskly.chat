responsibleArea: Backend Developer

Develop a robust system for delivering timely and relevant notifications across active user applications (web and desktop).
*   Implement a WebSocket or similar real-time communication channel (e.g., Socket.IO) for pushing notifications from the backend to connected client applications.
*   Design a flexible notification payload structure that includes content, notification type, and associated automation ID.
*   Ensure reliable and consistent delivery to all active client instances (web browser tabs, desktop Electron apps) for a given user.
*   Implement a queuing and retry mechanism for notifications to handle temporary client disconnections.
*   Consider scaling solutions for the notification service using AWS services or Kubernetes.
