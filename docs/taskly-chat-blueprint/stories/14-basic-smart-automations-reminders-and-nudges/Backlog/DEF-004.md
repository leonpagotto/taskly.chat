title: Define Data Model and Synchronization for Offline Automations
responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Design the data model for automation rules that can be stored and executed locally, focusing on parameters needed for offline context and execution.
*   Specify the schema for client-side IndexedDB/SQLite to store simple, time-based automation rules that can function offline.
*   Define the synchronization strategy between the client-side local storage and the server-side PostgreSQL database for automation rules, ensuring data consistency when the user transitions between online and offline states.
*   Outline the necessary API endpoints or WebSocket messages required to facilitate this bidirectional synchronization process.
