title: Implement Client-Side Logic for Offline Reminder Execution
responsibleArea: Frontend Developer (Web & Desktop)
---
Develop the client-side mechanism to store, evaluate, and trigger simple time-based reminders even when the user is offline.
*   Integrate with IndexedDB (for web) and/or SQLite (for Electron desktop app) to persist relevant automation rules locally, based on the data model defined by the Backend Developer.
*   Implement a client-side scheduler (e.g., using Web Workers for background processing in the browser or Electron's main process for desktop) to periodically check and trigger these locally managed reminders.
*   Develop the logic to display these locally-triggered notifications to the user through the existing notification display system.
*   Implement the synchronization logic, as defined by the Backend Developer, to pull and push automation rule changes when the application regains an online connection.
