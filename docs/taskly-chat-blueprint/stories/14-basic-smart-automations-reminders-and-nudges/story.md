title: 'Basic Smart Automations: Reminders and Nudges'
priority: High
---
As a user, I want to set up basic smart automations, such as context-aware reminders and nudges, so that Taskly.chat can proactively help me stay on track with my tasks and goals. This includes the ability to ask the AI to 'remind me about this meeting 15 minutes before' or 'nudge me to finish my report if I haven't started by 3 PM'. These automations should leverage my local persistent memory to understand context (e.g., my schedule, project deadlines, habits) and deliver timely and relevant notifications. I want to be able to easily create, view, and manage these basic automations through natural language interaction and a dedicated automation management interface, with options to pause, edit, or delete them. The notifications should be delivered across my active web and desktop applications, ensuring I don't miss important prompts. The system should prioritize the reliability and timeliness of these basic automations, ensuring they function even if I'm offline (where applicable, for locally managed reminders). This feature supports effortless productivity by providing intelligent, automated assistance, aligning with Taskly.chat's innovative approach to task management. The UI should be designed for clarity, allowing me to understand exactly when and why an automation will trigger, reinforcing user control.
