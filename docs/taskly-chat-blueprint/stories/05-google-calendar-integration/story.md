title: Google Calendar Integration
priority: Highest
---
As a user, I want to seamlessly integrate Taskly.chat with my Google Calendar, so that I can view my schedule, create new events, and receive context-aware reminders directly through the conversational interface. This integration should allow Taskly.chat to read my calendar events to inform AI responses (e.g., 'What's my next meeting?') and enable me to create new calendar entries using natural language (e.g., 'Schedule a call with John for tomorrow at 2 PM'). The system should handle secure OAuth 2.0 authentication for connecting my Google account and synchronize calendar data efficiently without storing sensitive information permanently on Taskly.chat servers, adhering to strict data privacy and security standards. I should be able to easily enable or disable this integration from my settings. This feature is crucial for enabling effortless productivity and seamless integration with existing workflows, allowing Taskly.chat to serve as a central hub for both personal and professional tasks. The integration should be reliable and performant, ensuring my calendar data is always up-to-date within Taskly.chat.
