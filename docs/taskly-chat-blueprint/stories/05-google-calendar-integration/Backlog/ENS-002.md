responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Implement robust measures to ensure secure and private handling of Google Calendar data. This involves:
- Encrypting Google API refresh tokens at rest.
- Designing an ephemeral data storage strategy for calendar event data (e.g., only storing relevant upcoming events in a temporary cache, or processing on-the-fly).
- Never permanently storing sensitive calendar event details on Taskly.chat servers.
- Implementing strict access controls to calendar data.
- Logging and auditing calendar data access for compliance.
