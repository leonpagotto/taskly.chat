Develop a backend service that allows creating new events in Google Calendar. This includes:
- An API endpoint to receive event details (title, start/end time, description, attendees).
- Logic to format the data and call the Google Calendar API (events.insert).
- Robust error handling for API calls.
- Ensuring proper permissions are handled for creating events.
