Design the AI logic to create and manage context-aware reminders based on Google Calendar events. This includes:
- Defining rules for when reminders should be triggered (e.g., '15 minutes before event', 'day before important meeting').
- Incorporating user preferences for reminder timings and delivery.
- Integrating reminder prompts naturally into the conversational flow.
