title: Enable AI to Create Google Calendar Events via Natural Language
responsibleArea: AI/ML Engineer
---
Implement the AI logic to parse and act on natural language requests for creating new calendar events. This involves:
- Enhancing NLU to extract event details (e.g., date, time, title, participants) from conversational input like 'Schedule a call with John for tomorrow at 2 PM'.
- Orchestrating the event creation process, potentially asking for clarification if details are missing.
- Calling the backend service to create the event in Google Calendar.
- Providing confirmation to the user through the conversational interface.
