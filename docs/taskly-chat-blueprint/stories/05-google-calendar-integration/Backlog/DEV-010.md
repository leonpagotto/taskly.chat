Build the frontend capabilities to display Google Calendar events within the Taskly.chat interface and enable user interactions. This includes:
- Visually representing calendar events fetched via the backend service in the chat history or a dedicated panel.
- Handling user input in the chat for both querying events ('show my meetings') and initiating event creation ('create event').
- Providing a rich and intuitive display for event details and confirmation messages.
