responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Create a backend service responsible for fetching calendar events from Google Calendar using the stored access tokens. This includes:
- API endpoints for clients/AI to request calendar data.
- Logic to call the Google Calendar API (events.list).
- Filtering events (e.g., by time range).
- Implementing efficient data synchronization strategy (e.g., incremental sync using `syncToken` or regular polling for relevant timeframes).
- Ensuring only necessary data is retrieved and processed, adhering to privacy standards.
