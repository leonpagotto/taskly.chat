responsibleArea: AI/ML Engineer

Adjust the AI service layer to conditionally provide access to specific AI models based on the user's active tier ("One-Time Fee Tier" should only get "Cheap AI" models).*   **Acceptance Criteria:**    *   User's tier is correctly identified.    *   Only permitted AI models are invoked.    *   Attempts to use premium AI models by One-Time Fee users are blocked/downgraded gracefully.
