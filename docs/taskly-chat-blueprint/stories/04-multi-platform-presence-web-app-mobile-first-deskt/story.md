title: 'Multi-Platform Presence: Web App (Mobile-First) & Desktop App'
priority: Highest
---
As a user, I want to access Taskly.chat through both a web application (designed mobile-first) and a dedicated desktop application (for Windows/macOS), so I can seamlessly manage my tasks and interactions from any device or environment I prefer. The web application should provide a fully responsive and optimized experience on mobile browsers, ensuring an intuitive UI and smooth performance. The desktop application, built with Electron leveraging the same Lobe-chat framework, should offer a native-like experience, including offline access to local memory and potentially system-level integrations (e.g., notifications). Both platforms must offer a consistent user experience, feature set (according to tier), and access to my local persistent memory. The development process must ensure code reusability between the web and desktop clients where possible, reducing fragmentation and ensuring feature parity. This foundational multi-platform launch is critical for reaching a broad user base and delivering on the project's promise of accessibility and value, with future plans for native Android and iOS apps. Performance and responsiveness must be maintained across all platforms, ensuring a delightful user experience regardless of the access point.
