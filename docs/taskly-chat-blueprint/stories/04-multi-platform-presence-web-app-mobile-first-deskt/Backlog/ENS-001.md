Review and validate all backend API endpoints to ensure they are consistently accessible and functional for both web and desktop clients. This involves:
- Verifying API authentication and authorization mechanisms work seamlessly across both platforms.
- Ensuring data payloads and response structures are compatible.
- Documenting any client-specific API usage or considerations.
- Addressing CORS policies for the web client and potential proxying for the desktop client.
