title: 'Cheap AI Tier: Unlimited Lightweight AI & User API Key Integration'
priority: Highest
---
As a price-sensitive user in the Cheap AI Tier, I want to access unlimited usage of lighter, cost-effective AI models (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Flash, GPT-4o-mini) for everyday task structuring, summaries, and light planning, so I can benefit from AI assistance without a high subscription cost. Additionally, I want the option to integrate my own AI API keys via a cheap subscription fee, allowing me to use my preferred AI models and manage my AI usage costs directly. This tier should offer unlimited projects and standard support. The system must provide a clear interface for entering and managing my AI API keys, with robust security measures to protect these credentials. When my own keys are integrated, Taskly.chat should route my AI requests through these keys while still leveraging its conversational interface and local memory. This tier is designed to accommodate users who are resistant to higher-priced subscriptions but desire unlimited AI or control over their AI models. It aligns with the principle of user empowerment and flexible AI model integration, while maintaining standard data privacy and security. The UI should clearly distinguish between Taskly-provided lightweight AI and AI powered by my own integrated keys, offering transparency and control.
