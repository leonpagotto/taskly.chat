Develop and integrate the backend logic for users to subscribe to the 'Cheap AI Tier'. This includes:
*   Payment gateway integration (Stripe/Paddle) for the cheap subscription fee.
*   Updating user account status to reflect 'Cheap AI Tier' membership.
*   Implementing access control mechanisms to unlock tier-specific features (unlimited projects, AI model access).
*   Ensuring smooth upgrade/downgrade paths from other tiers.
