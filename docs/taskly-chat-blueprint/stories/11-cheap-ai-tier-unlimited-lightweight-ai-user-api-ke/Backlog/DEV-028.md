title: Develop Dynamic AI Request Routing Logic
responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Implement the core logic to dynamically route AI requests based on user configuration and tier:
*   Identify the user's current subscription tier.
*   Check if the user has integrated their own AI API keys and if they are activated for use.
*   If user-provided keys are active, route AI requests through the user's selected LLM via their provided API key.
*   Otherwise (or if no user key is active), route AI requests to Taskly-provided lightweight AI models for 'Cheap AI Tier' users.
*   Ensure that conversational context and local persistent memory data are consistently and securely passed to the chosen AI model, regardless of its source.
