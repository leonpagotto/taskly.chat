responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Create secure backend API endpoints and services for users to manage their own AI API keys:
*   Endpoint for submitting and storing new AI API keys (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) securely.
*   Endpoints for updating or revoking existing stored API keys.
*   Implementation of robust security measures for API keys:
    *   Encryption at rest using industry-standard methods (e.g., AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault).
    *   Strict access control to API keys.
    *   Logging and auditing of API key management actions.
    *   Ensuring API keys are never exposed in plaintext in logs or client-side responses.
