title: Implement AI Source Indication in Conversational UI
responsibleArea: Frontend Developer (Web & Desktop)
---
Develop and integrate visual cues into the main conversational interface to clearly indicate the source of AI responses:
*   Based on UI/UX designs, display a distinctive label, icon, or styling next to AI-generated content.
*   Labels should clearly differentiate between 'Taskly AI' (lightweight, Taskly-provided) and 'My [LLM Name]' (user-provided API key).
*   Ensure consistent presentation across all platforms (web, desktop) and mobile-first responsiveness for web.
