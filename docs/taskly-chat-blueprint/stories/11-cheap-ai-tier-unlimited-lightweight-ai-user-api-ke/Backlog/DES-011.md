Design the user experience and interface for the 'Cheap AI Tier' and user API key integration:
*   **Subscription Flow:** Wireframes and mockups for the Cheap AI Tier signup/upgrade process.
*   **AI Settings Section:** Design a dedicated section (e.g., 'AI Integrations' or 'Developer Settings') within user preferences for entering, viewing, and managing personal AI API keys.
*   **Visual Distinction:** Create clear visual indicators (icons, labels, color cues) within the chat interface to distinguish between responses from Taskly-provided lightweight AI and user-provided AI models.
*   Ensure designs adhere to mobile-first principles for the web application.
