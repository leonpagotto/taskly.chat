*   **Security Testing:** Conduct penetration testing and vulnerability assessments for API key storage and handling.
*   **AI Routing:** Validate that AI requests are correctly routed based on user tier and API key integration status.
*   **Context & Memory:** Confirm that conversational context and local memory are correctly passed to both Taskly-provided and user-provided AI models.
*   **UI Verification:** Ensure all UI elements, including AI source indicators, function as designed and are visually consistent.
*   **Performance:** Evaluate the performance and scalability of the AI routing and lightweight AI models.
