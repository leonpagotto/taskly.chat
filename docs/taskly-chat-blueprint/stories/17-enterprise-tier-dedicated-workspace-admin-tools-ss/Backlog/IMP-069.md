title: Implement Enterprise-wide Automation and Integration Management APIs
responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Extend existing automation and third-party integration features to allow enterprise administrators to configure, manage, and enforce team-wide automations and integrations (e.g., Google Calendar, Slack, Trello, Asana) that apply uniformly to all users within their dedicated workspace.    *   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   APIs enable administrators to create/modify global automations for the tenant.
    *   APIs support configuring tenant-wide integrations with external services.
    *   Tenant-wide settings override individual user settings for enforced policies.
    *   Permissions for configuring these settings are restricted to enterprise admins.
