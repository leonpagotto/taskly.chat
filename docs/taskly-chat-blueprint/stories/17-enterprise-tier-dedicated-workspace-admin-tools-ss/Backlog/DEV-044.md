Create a comprehensive set of RESTful APIs for enterprise administrators to manage users and assign roles within their dedicated workspace. These APIs will allow for adding, editing, deactivating users, and defining/assigning enterprise-specific roles with granular permissions.    *   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   APIs exist for CRUD operations on enterprise users.
    *   APIs allow assignment of custom roles with defined permissions.
    *   User authentication and authorization within the enterprise context are enforced.
    *   API responses are secure and do not expose sensitive data cross-tenant.
