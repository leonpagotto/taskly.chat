responsibleArea: DevOps Engineer
---
Set up and configure the cloud infrastructure (AWS) to support isolated and scalable environments for enterprise clients. This includes provisioning dedicated resources, establishing secure networking (e.g., VPCs, subnets), implementing robust access controls, and ensuring tenant-specific scaling for each workspace.    *   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   Infrastructure is provisioned to support multi-tenancy securely.
    *   Network isolation between enterprise workspaces is verified.
    *   Monitoring and logging are enabled for tenant-specific infrastructure.
    *   Scalability solutions are in place to handle growth per tenant.
