Deploy and configure advanced monitoring, logging, and alerting systems specifically tailored for the Enterprise Tier to ensure high standards of data privacy, security, and compliance. This includes implementing intrusion detection, vulnerability scanning, data encryption at rest and in transit, and robust audit trail capabilities.    *   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   Security logs and events are collected and centralized.
    *   Alerting is configured for suspicious activities or compliance breaches.
    *   Data encryption at rest (e.g., database, S3) and in transit (e.g., TLS) is enforced.
    *   Regular security scans are automated.
