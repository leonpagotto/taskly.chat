responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Implement backend services to collect, securely store, and expose usage data and audit logs specific to each enterprise tenant. These APIs will provide administrators with insights into user activity, API calls, automation executions, and compliance-relevant events within their workspace.    *   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   Usage metrics (e.g., active users, task completions, AI usage) are collected per tenant.
    *   Audit logs for critical actions (e.g., user management, configuration changes) are recorded.
    *   APIs allow filtering, searching, and retrieving audit logs based on various criteria.
    *   Data retention policies for logs are configurable/adhere to enterprise requirements.
