responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Design and implement the backend architecture to support dedicated, isolated workspaces for enterprise clients. This involves configuring data partitioning, implementing robust tenant isolation logic, and ensuring all data, configurations, and AI contexts are strictly segmented per enterprise.    *   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   Data for each enterprise tenant is logically and/or physically isolated.
    *   Configurations and settings are tenant-specific and not accessible across workspaces.
    *   API requests are correctly routed and authenticated to the respective tenant's data.
    *   Performance impact of multi-tenancy is within acceptable limits.
