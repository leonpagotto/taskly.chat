Implement Single Sign-On (SSO) integration using industry standards like SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect. This involves developing backend services to facilitate SSO authentication, allowing enterprise administrators to configure and enforce SSO for their organization's users.    *   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   Supports at least one major SSO protocol (e.g., SAML 2.0).
    *   Administrators can configure SSO settings (e.g., IdP metadata, certificates).
    *   Users can successfully authenticate via SSO without traditional password login.
    *   Role mapping from IdP attributes to Taskly.chat roles is configurable.
