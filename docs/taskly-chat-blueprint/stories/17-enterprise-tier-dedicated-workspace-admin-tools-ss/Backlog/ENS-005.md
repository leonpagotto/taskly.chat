responsibleArea: AI/ML Engineer
---
Implement and verify measures to guarantee that AI models (Gemini, user-provided LLMs) strictly adhere to the dedicated workspace isolation. This task focuses on preventing any cross-tenant data leakage or context mixing, ensuring that prompts, responses, and local memory data are handled securely and remain confined within each enterprise's environment.    *   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   AI model interactions are confined to the respective tenant's context.
    *   No cross-tenant data leakage is possible via AI model inputs or outputs.
    *   Security audits confirm the isolation of sensitive information processed by AI.
    *   Data anonymization/encryption for AI processing is considered and implemented where necessary.
