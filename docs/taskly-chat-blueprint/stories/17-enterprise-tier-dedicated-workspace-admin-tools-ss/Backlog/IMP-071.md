title: Implement Enterprise-wide Automation and Integration Configuration UI
responsibleArea: Frontend Developer (Web & Desktop)
---
Create the user interface within the Enterprise Admin Dashboard for administrators to configure and manage team-wide automations and third-party integrations (e.g., Google Calendar, Slack, Trello, Asana). This UI ensures settings can be applied uniformly across their organization, overriding individual user preferences where necessary.    *   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   UI allows creation and management of enterprise-level automations.
    *   UI facilitates configuration of shared integrations for the entire tenant.
    *   Clear indication of whether an automation/integration is mandatory or configurable by users.
    *   Admin permissions are enforced for these settings.
