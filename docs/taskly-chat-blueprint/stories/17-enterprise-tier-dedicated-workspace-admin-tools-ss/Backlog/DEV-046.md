Build the user interface that allows enterprise administrators to configure, test, and activate Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with their corporate identity provider. This includes input fields for IdP metadata, certificate upload, and testing functionality to ensure successful integration.    *   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    *   UI provides fields for entering SSO configuration details (e.g., metadata URL, certificates).
    *   A "Test SSO" button or equivalent functionality is present and verifies configuration.
    *   Clear instructions and error messages are displayed during configuration.
    *   Enforcement options for SSO (e.g., mandatory for all users) are available.
