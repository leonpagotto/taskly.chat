responsibleArea: Backend Developer

Develop a robust feature flagging or access control system within the backend to restrict or enable specific workflow tools and third-party integrations based on the user's subscription tier. This includes:
*   Defining which workflow tools are 'basic' and accessible to Free Tier users.
*   Ensuring the listed basic integrations (Google Calendar, Outlook, Slack, Trello, Asana) are enabled for Free Tier users.
*   Implementing API-level checks to prevent Free Tier users from accessing paid-tier features or unauthorized integrations.
*   Providing clear API responses when access is denied.
