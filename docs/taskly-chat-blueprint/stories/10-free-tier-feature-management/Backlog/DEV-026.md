Create a comprehensive suite of test plans and automated test cases specifically for Free Tier functionalities. This includes:
*   Verifying correct enforcement of project limits (e.g., attempting to create a 4th project).
*   Testing AI request metering accuracy and limit enforcement (e.g., exceeding the monthly AI request limit).
*   Confirming proper access control for basic and restricted workflow tools/integrations.
*   Validating the correct display of tier status, usage metrics, and upgrade prompts in the UI.
*   Testing the system's behavior when limits are approached and exceeded, ensuring graceful handling and correct messaging.
*   Performing end-to-end tests for the entire Free Tier user journey, including attempting to upgrade.
