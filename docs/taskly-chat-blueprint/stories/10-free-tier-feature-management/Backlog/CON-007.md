Research, integrate, and configure a cost-effective and lightweight AI model (e.g., a smaller variant of Gemini or an optimized open-source model) to be exclusively utilized by Free Tier users. This task includes:
*   Identifying a suitable AI model that meets the 'very limited AI requests' criteria while still providing core functionality.
*   Configuring the AI service to route Free Tier requests to this specific lightweight model.
*   Ensuring the model is correctly integrated with the existing AI backend infrastructure.
