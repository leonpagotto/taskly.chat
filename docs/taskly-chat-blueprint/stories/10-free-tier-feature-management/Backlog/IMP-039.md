responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Develop and deploy backend services responsible for tracking and limiting AI requests for Free Tier users (e.g., 20-30 per month). This involves:
*   Establishing a mechanism to store and retrieve the monthly AI request count for each Free Tier user.
*   Implementing a recurring process to reset monthly AI request counts.
*   Integrating a middleware or interceptor into AI-related API calls to check the user's remaining request quota.
*   Blocking AI requests and returning appropriate HTTP error codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) when a Free Tier user exceeds their monthly limit.
