responsibleArea: Frontend Developer (Web & Desktop)

Develop and integrate UI components across the web and desktop applications to clearly communicate a Free Tier user's status and current limitations. This includes:
*   A prominent display indicating the user is on the 'Free Tier'.
*   A dedicated section (e.g., a dashboard widget or settings page) showing current usage against limits (e.g., '2/3 Active Projects', '15/30 AI Requests Used').
*   Visual cues or indicators for features that are limited or restricted for Free Tier users.
*   Ensuring the display is responsive and mobile-first for the web application.
