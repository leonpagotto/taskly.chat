responsibleArea: Frontend Developer (Web & Desktop)

Develop the necessary UI/UX logic and components to gracefully manage feature restrictions and encourage upgrades for Free Tier users. This involves:
*   Implementing in-app notifications or banners that appear when limits are approached (e.g., 'You have 5 AI requests left').
*   Displaying clear and actionable upgrade prompts when limits are exceeded (e.g., 'You've reached your monthly AI limit. Upgrade to continue using AI.').
*   Visually disabling or graying out restricted features with tooltips explaining the limitation and suggesting an upgrade.
*   Ensuring a smooth user experience even with limitations, guiding users towards the upgrade path without causing frustration.
