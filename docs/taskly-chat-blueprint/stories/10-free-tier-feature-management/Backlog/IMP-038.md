title: Implement Free Tier project limits backend logic
responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Develop and implement backend services to enforce a maximum number of active projects (e.g., 3) for Free Tier users. This includes:
*   Updating database schema if necessary to store project ownership and active status.
*   Implementing validation logic in the project creation API to prevent Free Tier users from exceeding the limit.
*   Adding logic to manage project status (active/inactive) and ensure only active projects count towards the limit.
*   Returning clear error messages to the frontend when a Free Tier user attempts to exceed their project limit.
