title: Natural Language Conversation with Gemini AI
priority: Highest
---
As a user, I want to interact with Taskly.chat using natural language in a conversation-centric interface, initially powered by Gemini models, so I can intuitively capture my thoughts, tasks, and requests. This includes the ability to ask questions, give instructions, summarize information, and brainstorm ideas, with the AI understanding my intent and providing relevant responses or actions. The interface should be responsive and fluid across both web (mobile-first) and desktop platforms, making the interaction feel natural and seamless. The AI should demonstrate natural language understanding (NLU) to parse my input and natural language generation (NLG) to formulate coherent and contextually appropriate replies. My conversations should be maintained within a session, allowing for follow-up questions and refined requests, enhancing the feeling of a continuous dialogue. The system must process my conversational input efficiently to minimize latency, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience that aligns with the project's principle of effortless productivity through intelligent assistance. The UI will leverage the Lobe-chat framework to provide an engaging and familiar chat experience. All interactions must respect user privacy, processing data in a manner compliant with standard required data privacy and security measures.
