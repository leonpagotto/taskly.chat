title: Custom Automation Rules and Conditional Triggers
priority: High
---
As a user, I want to define advanced custom automation rules and conditional triggers, going beyond basic reminders, so that I can create sophisticated, intelligent workflows tailored to my specific needs. This includes setting up rules like 'If an email from John arrives containing 'urgent' AND I have no meetings in the next hour, then create a high-priority task in Asana and send me a Slack notification.' I want a user-friendly interface (potentially a visual rule builder or natural language rule definition) to specify conditions (e.g., time-based, event-based from integrations, keyword detection) and actions (e.g., create task, send message, update memory, trigger another AI action). These custom rules should leverage my local persistent memory and integrations to access relevant data and trigger actions across platforms. The system must provide robust logic for evaluating conditions and executing actions reliably. This feature is core to achieving 'instruction-driven behavior' and 'intelligent automation', offering unparalleled personalization and productivity. All custom automation logic and associated data handling must comply with standard required data privacy and security measures, especially when interacting with third-party services. The ability to test and debug these rules within the UI would also be highly beneficial for ensuring their correct functionality.
