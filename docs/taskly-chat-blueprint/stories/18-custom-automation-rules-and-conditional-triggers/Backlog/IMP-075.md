title: Implement Testing and Debugging Infrastructure for Rules
responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Develop the backend and API support necessary for users to test and debug their custom automation rules from the UI. This includes:
*   Creating API endpoints that allow users to 'simulate' an event trigger against a specific rule.
*   Implementing a mechanism to log the evaluation steps and outcomes of a rule during testing (e.g., which conditions passed/failed, which actions were attempted).
*   Providing clear error messages or diagnostic information for rules that do not behave as expected.
