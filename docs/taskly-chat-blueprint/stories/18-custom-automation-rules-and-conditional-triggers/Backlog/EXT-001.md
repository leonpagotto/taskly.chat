Modify existing and implement new integration components to provide event notifications relevant for custom automation rules. This task includes:
*   Setting up webhooks or polling mechanisms to receive notifications from services like email providers (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) for new email arrivals, calendar updates, etc.
*   Standardizing the event payload structure for consistency across different integration sources.
*   Ensuring secure and efficient data transfer from third-party services to the rule evaluation engine.
