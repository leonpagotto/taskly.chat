Create a detailed test plan for the custom automation rules and conditional triggers feature. This includes:
*   Defining various test scenarios covering different types of conditions (time-based, event-based, keyword) and actions (task creation, notifications, memory updates, AI actions).
*   Developing test cases for complex rule logic (AND/OR combinations, nested conditions).
*   Planning integration tests with all supported third-party services and the local persistent memory.
*   Outlining performance and stress tests for the rule evaluation engine.
