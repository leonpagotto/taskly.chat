responsibleArea: Product Manager

Refine the detailed requirements for the custom automation rules feature and define the initial scope for implementation. This task includes:
*   Identifying the initial set of conditions (e.g., which email events, calendar events, time triggers) and actions (e.g., which integrations, memory operations, AI actions) to support.
*   Establishing clear acceptance criteria for the 'user-friendly interface' and 'robust logic'.
*   Prioritizing which integrations will be enabled for rule triggers and actions in the first iteration.
*   Gathering further user feedback on desired rule complexity and functionality.
