responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Create a secure and efficient data access layer that allows the rule evaluation engine to query and update the user's local persistent memory. This task involves:
*   Defining APIs or methods for the rule engine to read context (e.g., user preferences, past interactions, learned facts) from the persistent memory.
*   Implementing functionalities for rules to write or modify data within the persistent memory as an action.
*   Ensuring data consistency and handling concurrency for memory operations during rule execution.
