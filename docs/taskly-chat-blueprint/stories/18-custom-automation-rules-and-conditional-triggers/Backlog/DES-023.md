title: Design UI/UX for Custom Automation Rule Builder
responsibleArea: UI/UX Designer
---
Design a user-friendly interface for defining custom automation rules and conditional triggers. This should include:
*   Wireframes and mockups for a visual rule builder (e.g., drag-and-drop components for conditions and actions).
*   Interaction flows for selecting event sources, defining conditions (time-based, event-based, keyword detection).
*   Interaction flows for selecting and configuring actions (create task, send message, update memory, trigger AI action).
*   Design components for testing and debugging rules within the UI.
*   Ensure the design accommodates future natural language input options.
