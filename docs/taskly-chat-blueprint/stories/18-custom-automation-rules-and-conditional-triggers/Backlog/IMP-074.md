responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Develop a module that reliably executes the actions defined in triggered automation rules. This involves:
*   Creating connectors/adapters for various third-party services (e.g., Asana, Slack, Google Calendar) to perform actions like 'create task', 'send message', 'update event'.
*   Developing internal logic to update user's local persistent memory and trigger other AI actions as specified in rules.
*   Implementing robust retry mechanisms and error reporting for failed action executions.
*   Ensuring secure handling of API keys and credentials for third-party services during action execution.
