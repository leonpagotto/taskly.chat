title: Integrate AI/ML Capabilities for Rule Conditions and Actions
responsibleArea: AI/ML Engineer

Enhance the rule engine's capabilities by integrating AI/ML models. This includes:
*   Developing functionalities for AI models to detect keywords or patterns within incoming data (e.g., 'urgent' in an email subject) as part of rule conditions.
*   Creating internal APIs or service interfaces for the rule engine to trigger specific AI model behaviors (e.g., 'summarize content', 'generate a draft reply') as an action.
*   If natural language rule definition is pursued, develop an NLU component to parse user input into structured rule data.
