responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Develop API endpoints for authenticated users to manage their profile details. This includes:
*   Creating a GET /users/me endpoint to retrieve the current user's profile information.
*   Creating a PATCH /users/me endpoint to allow updates to non-sensitive profile details (e.g., name, display name).
*   Implementing proper authorization to ensure users can only update their own profiles.
*   Ensuring data validation and secure storage for updated information.
