Develop the client-side functionality for secure logout, including revoking all active sessions. This task includes:
*   Adding a 'Logout' option in the UI that triggers a call to the /auth/logout API endpoint.
*   Adding a 'Logout All Devices' option that triggers a call to the /auth/logout-all API endpoint.
*   Clearing client-side stored authentication tokens upon logout.
*   Redirecting the user to the login page after successful logout.
