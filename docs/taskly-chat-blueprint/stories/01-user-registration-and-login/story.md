title: User Registration and Login
priority: Highest
---
As a new user, I want to easily create an account and log in, so I can start using Taskly.chat and access its features securely. This includes basic email/password authentication and secure session management for both web and desktop applications. For existing users, I want to be able to reset my password if forgotten to regain access to my account without hassle. As a logged-in user, I want to manage my profile details such as name and email address, so I can keep my information up-to-date. As a user, I want to securely log out of Taskly.chat across all active sessions, so I can protect my account from unauthorized access if I am using a shared device or want to end my session. All data handling and storage must comply with standard required data privacy and security measures, ensuring my personal information is protected during registration and login processes. The UI for registration and login should be intuitive and responsive, following a mobile-first design approach for the web application and maintaining consistency in the desktop app, leveraging the Lobe-chat framework's capabilities for a smooth user experience. Error messages should be clear and helpful, guiding me if I encounter any issues during the process. Overall, the system should prioritize a seamless, secure, and user-friendly entry point into the Taskly.chat ecosystem, aligning with the project's principles of user empowerment and privacy-by-design from the very beginning of the user journey.
