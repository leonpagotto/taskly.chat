title: Local Persistent Personal Memory
priority: Highest
---
As a user, I want Taskly.chat to store my personal preferences, routines, priorities, important dates, and past interactions in a local persistent memory on my device, so that my personal context is continuously maintained and easily accessible, enhancing my privacy and enabling personalized assistance without my data residing solely in the cloud. This memory should inform AI responses and automations, making my experience increasingly tailored over time. I expect this memory to be resilient to application restarts and available offline, ensuring that my core personal data is always under my control and accessible. The system should allow me to view and manage (edit/delete) entries in my local memory, giving me full control over my stored information. The implementation must adhere strictly to the principle of privacy-by-design, ensuring that this local storage is secure and protected against unauthorized access on my device. This feature is crucial for fulfilling the project's promise of enhanced privacy and control, empowering me as a user with my data management, and should function seamlessly across both the web (using browser storage like IndexedDB) and desktop (using local file storage or SQLite) applications. The local memory will be used by the AI to understand my context better, making interactions more relevant and intelligent, aligning with the value of innovation and user empowerment.
