Conduct security testing to ensure the local persistent memory is protected against unauthorized access and tampering. This involves:
*   Attempting to access or modify local data through unintended means (e.g., browser developer tools, direct file system access for desktop).
*   Verifying encryption mechanisms for sensitive data where implemented.
*   Assessing adherence to privacy-by-design principles for local data storage.
