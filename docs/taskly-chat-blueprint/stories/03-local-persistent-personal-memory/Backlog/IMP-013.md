Implement client-side security measures to protect the local persistent memory from unauthorized access on the user's device. This task involves:
*   Evaluating and implementing appropriate encryption for sensitive data stored locally (e.g., using Web Crypto API for IndexedDB, or OS-level protections for desktop file storage).
*   Ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering.
*   Adhering to privacy-by-design principles for local data storage.
