responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Collaborate with AI/ML Engineer and Frontend Developers to define the server-side schema for processing the local memory context received from the client. This involves:
*   Establishing the data model for the context payload that the backend expects.
*   Ensuring compatibility with AI model input requirements.
*   Considering potential future enhancements like server-side processing or synchronization of certain aspects of user memory (if applicable beyond the initial local focus).
