responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Develop a secure API endpoint on the backend to receive the prepared local memory context from the client and transmit it to the Gemini (or other LLM) API. This task involves:
*   Creating a robust and secure endpoint to accept contextual data from the frontend.
*   Implementing data validation and sanitization for incoming context.
*   Acting as a proxy to securely forward the contextual data along with user prompts to the external AI API.
*   Ensuring minimal necessary data is transmitted and adhering to privacy standards during transit.
