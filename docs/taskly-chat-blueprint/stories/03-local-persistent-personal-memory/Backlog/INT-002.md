responsibleArea: Frontend Developer (Web & Desktop)
---
Implement the logic within the frontend to retrieve relevant local memory context and prepare it for transmission to the AI model. This includes:
*   Developing mechanisms to query and select specific memory entries based on current conversation or task context.
*   Formatting the selected memory data into a structured payload suitable for the AI API (e.g., JSON).
*   Integrating this context preparation into the AI interaction flow, ensuring privacy by only sending necessary context.
