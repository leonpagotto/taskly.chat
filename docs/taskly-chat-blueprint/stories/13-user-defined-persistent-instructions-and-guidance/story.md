title: User-defined Persistent Instructions and Guidance
priority: High
---
As a user, I want to define persistent instructions and guidance that Taskly.chat's AI will follow, either globally or within specific project spaces, so that I can customize the AI's behavior and output according to my preferences and workflow. This includes setting preferred tones for responses, defining specific formatting requirements, establishing default priority levels for tasks, or providing context-specific rules for how the AI should interpret my requests. These instructions should be easily editable and reviewable, providing me with clear control over the AI's directives. The system should ensure that these instructions are stored locally as part of my persistent memory, maintaining privacy and consistency across sessions and platforms. When interacting with the AI, the system should dynamically apply these instructions to influence the AI's natural language understanding and generation, ensuring that the AI consistently acts according to my explicit guidance. This feature is essential for enabling personalized and instruction-driven AI behavior, a core principle of Taskly.chat, and reinforces the value of clarity and control for users. The UI for defining and managing these instructions should be intuitive and accessible from the main application interface, supporting both personal and professional contexts.
