responsibleArea: Frontend Developer (Web & Desktop)

Implement the logic to securely store and retrieve user-defined instructions using client-side persistent memory (IndexedDB/SQLite) to ensure privacy and local availability. This task focuses on the direct interaction with local storage.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Global and project-specific instructions are successfully stored in IndexedDB/SQLite on the client side.
    *   Stored instructions persist reliably across browser sessions and application restarts.
    *   Mechanisms for retrieving instruction data from local storage are optimized for efficient performance.
    *   Robust error handling and data integrity checks are implemented for all local storage operations.
