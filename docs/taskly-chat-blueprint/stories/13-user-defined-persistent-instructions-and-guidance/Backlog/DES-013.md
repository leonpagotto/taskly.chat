responsibleArea: UI/UX Designer
---
Design wireframes, mockups, and prototypes for an intuitive user interface to define, view, edit, and delete persistent instructions. This includes designing components for both global and project-specific instruction management. Design should ensure a clear distinction between global and project-level settings.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Layout for managing global instructions versus project-specific instructions is clearly defined.
    *   Input components for various instruction types (e.g., tone, formatting, task priority, specific rules) are designed.
    *   User flow for applying/removing instructions to designated project spaces is mapped out and intuitive.
    *   Mobile-first design principles are integrated for the web application interface.
