Develop the front-end components for defining, managing, and applying user-defined persistent instructions based on the approved UI/UX designs. This involves creating interactive elements for inputting, editing, reviewing, and deleting instruction sets.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   User interface allows for the creation, editing, and saving of global persistent instructions.
    *   User interface allows for the creation, editing, and saving of project-specific persistent instructions, linked to defined project spaces.
    *   Instructions can be easily reviewed, updated, and deleted via the application interface.
    *   Functional input fields or dropdowns for common instruction types (e.g., preferred tone, output format) are implemented.
    *   Responsive design ensures the instruction management interface is accessible and functional across various screen sizes and devices.
