title: Develop Instruction Synchronization Service
responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Create secure API endpoints and backend logic to enable synchronization of user-defined instructions across different platforms (web, desktop, future mobile apps) for 'consistency across sessions and platforms'. This is crucial for a unified user experience, especially for instructions linked to collaborative 'project spaces'.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Secure API endpoints are available for uploading and downloading user instruction data (global and project-linked) by authenticated users.
    *   A robust conflict resolution strategy is implemented to handle simultaneous updates to instruction sets across different clients.
    *   Data privacy and security protocols (e.g., encryption, access controls) are strictly adhered to during the synchronization process.
    *   The service integrates with PostgreSQL for server-side persistence of synchronized instruction data.
