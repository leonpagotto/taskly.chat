title: Develop and Execute Test Plan for User Instructions
responsibleArea: QA Engineer
---
Create a comprehensive test plan and execute tests to thoroughly verify the functionality, persistence, synchronization, and AI adherence aspects of the user-defined instructions feature across all supported platforms (web, desktop).
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Test cases cover the full lifecycle of defining, editing, applying, and deleting both global and project-specific instructions.
    *   Tests confirm that instructions persist correctly across multiple sessions, application restarts, and different platforms.
    *   Integration tests verify that AI responses accurately reflect the defined tones, formatting, and contextual rules.
    *   Edge cases, such as conflicting instructions (global vs. project), very long instructions, or invalid inputs, are identified and tested.
    *   End-to-end tests confirm seamless interaction between the UI, local storage, backend sync service, and AI processing.
