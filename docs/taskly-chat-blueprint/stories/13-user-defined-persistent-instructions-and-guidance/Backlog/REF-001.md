title: Refine AI Response Adherence and NLU with Instructions
responsibleArea: AI/ML Engineer

Enhance the AI interaction and natural language understanding (NLU) components to ensure that AI responses consistently adhere to user-defined tone, formatting, default priority levels, and context-specific interpretation rules. This involves fine-tuning AI behavior based on injected instructions.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   AI-generated responses consistently reflect the user's preferred tone (e.g., formal, casual, enthusiastic) as defined in the instructions.
    *   AI output strictly adheres to specified formatting requirements (e.g., markdown lists, code blocks, specific data structures).
    *   The AI's NLU component correctly interprets user requests, taking into account context-specific rules and default task priority levels provided in the instructions.
    *   Mechanisms are established to effectively monitor and test the AI's adherence to various types of user-defined instructions.
