title: Implement Dynamic Instruction Injection into AI Prompts
responsibleArea: AI/ML Engineer
---
Develop the core logic to dynamically retrieve user-defined persistent instructions and inject them into the AI model's prompts. This will involve careful prompt engineering to ensure instructions are effectively communicated to the Gemini API and other integrated LLMs.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Global instructions are consistently and correctly prepended or appended to AI model prompts for all interactions.
    *   Logic is implemented to ensure project-specific instructions accurately override or complement global instructions when active within a particular project context.
    *   Instructions are formatted appropriately for optimal interpretation by the Gemini API and other supported LLM APIs.
    *   The process of injecting instructions into prompts introduces minimal latency and does not degrade AI response times.
