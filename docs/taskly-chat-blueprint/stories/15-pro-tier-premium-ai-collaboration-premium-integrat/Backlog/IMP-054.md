title: Implement Pro Tier Feature Gating and Upgrade Prompts
responsibleArea: Frontend Developer (Web & Desktop)
---
Develop frontend logic to gate Pro Tier specific features and provide clear upgrade paths for users on lower tiers. This involves:
*   Integrating with the backend subscription management API to determine the user's current tier.
*   Conditionally rendering or disabling Pro Tier UI elements (e.g., premium AI model selection, collaboration buttons, advanced integration options).
*   Displaying clear upgrade prompts or tooltips when a user attempts to access a Pro Tier feature without the required subscription.
*   Ensuring a seamless redirection to the subscription management page upon interaction with an upgrade prompt.
