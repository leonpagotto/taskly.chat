title: 'Pro Tier: Premium AI, Collaboration & Premium Integrations'
priority: High
---
As a power user or professional in the Pro Tier, I want access to premium AI models with advanced reasoning and planning capabilities, so I can handle complex automation and sophisticated task management. This includes unlimited AI credits with a fair use policy. I also require optional collaboration features to share projects or threads with others, ensuring consistent AI-generated output for my team. Furthermore, I need premium integrations with tools like GitHub, Jira, and Notion to streamline my advanced workflows. The system should provide a robust and intuitive interface for managing shared projects, inviting collaborators, and defining access permissions. The premium integrations should offer deeper functionality compared to basic ones, allowing for more advanced synchronization and automation. This tier is designed to anchor pricing at a higher value, encouraging upgrades from the Cheap AI Tier by providing advanced capabilities crucial for professional use cases. All features must adhere to standard data privacy and security measures, especially concerning shared data and sensitive integrations. The UI should clearly distinguish Pro Tier features and provide a seamless experience for collaboration and advanced AI usage.
