Develop the AI logic to process extracted Asana intents and parameters, interact with the backend Asana integration, and generate natural language responses. This task includes:
*   Mapping identified intents to specific Asana API calls (utilizing the Backend Developer's client).
*   Constructing appropriate JSON payloads for Asana API requests based on extracted parameters.
*   Generating clear, concise, and contextually relevant conversational responses to users, confirming actions, requesting more information, or reporting errors.
*   Implementing robust handling for edge cases, such as missing parameters or ambiguous user requests.
