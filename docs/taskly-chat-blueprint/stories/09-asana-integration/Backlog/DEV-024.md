Train and integrate natural language processing models to accurately understand user requests related to Asana task management. This task includes:
*   Identifying core intents such as 'create task', 'update task', 'assign task', 'set due date', and 'query tasks/projects'.
*   Developing robust entity extraction for parameters from user utterances: task name, project, assignee, due date, status, priority, and description.
*   Integrating the NLP pipeline with the core AI/ML framework to accurately route Asana-related queries to the appropriate backend integration service.
