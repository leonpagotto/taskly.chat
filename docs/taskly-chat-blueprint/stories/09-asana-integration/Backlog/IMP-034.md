title: Implement Bidirectional Data Synchronization with Asana
responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Design and implement a mechanism for keeping Taskly.chat and Asana data in sync, ensuring real-time updates and accuracy. This task includes:
*   Exploring and implementing webhook-based updates from Asana to Taskly.chat for near real-time changes (preferred approach).
*   If webhooks are insufficient, implementing a robust polling mechanism for updates, considering Asana's rate limits and efficiency.
*   Ensuring changes made in Taskly.chat are accurately reflected in Asana (e.g., status updates, task creation).
*   Handling conflict resolution strategies if bidirectional updates occur simultaneously.
*   Managing data consistency and integrity during all synchronization operations.
