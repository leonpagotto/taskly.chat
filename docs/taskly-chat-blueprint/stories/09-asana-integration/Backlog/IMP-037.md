responsibleArea: Frontend Developer (Web & Desktop)

Create a user interface allowing users to select and manage which Asana workspaces and projects Taskly.chat can access, aligning with backend granular permission logic. This task includes:
*   Displaying an intuitive list of available Asana workspaces/projects after successful authentication.
*   Allowing users to easily select or deselect specific items (e.g., using checkboxes or toggles).
*   Providing clear visual feedback on the currently chosen permissions.
*   Ensuring that any changes to permissions are communicated securely and effectively to the backend for enforcement.
