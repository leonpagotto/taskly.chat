responsibleArea: Backend Developer
---
Develop backend logic to allow users to control which Asana workspaces or projects Taskly.chat can access, ensuring data security and privacy. This task includes:
*   Designing and implementing schema for storing user-defined permissions mappings (e.g., Taskly.chat user ID to Asana workspace/project IDs).
*   Enforcing these permissions on all outgoing API calls to Asana.
*   Implementing logic to present available workspaces/projects to the user for selection.
*   Ensuring compliance with data privacy standards for all Asana data handled and exchanged.
