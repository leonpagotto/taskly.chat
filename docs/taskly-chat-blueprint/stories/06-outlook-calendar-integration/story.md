title: Outlook Calendar Integration
priority: Highest
---
As a user, I want to seamlessly integrate Taskly.chat with my Outlook Calendar, so that I can manage my schedule, create new appointments, and receive timely notifications through the conversational interface. This integration should enable Taskly.chat to read my Outlook events to provide contextual information to the AI (e.g., 'Do I have any free slots tomorrow?') and allow me to add new calendar entries using natural language (e.g., 'Block out an hour for deep work next Monday morning'). The system must implement secure OAuth 2.0 authentication for connecting my Outlook account and ensure efficient synchronization of calendar data, adhering to robust data privacy and security standards. I should have the option to easily enable or disable this integration from my Taskly.chat settings. This integration is vital for professionals using Microsoft ecosystems, facilitating seamless workflow synchronization and making Taskly.chat a comprehensive personal and professional assistant. The integration needs to be performant, ensuring accurate and up-to-date calendar information within Taskly.chat.
