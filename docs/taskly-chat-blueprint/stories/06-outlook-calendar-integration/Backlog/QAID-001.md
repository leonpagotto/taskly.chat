Develop and execute a comprehensive test plan to ensure the Outlook Calendar integration functions correctly, securely, and efficiently.
*   **Functional Testing:** Verify OAuth 2.0 connection, disconnection, and re-connection flows. Test reading (fetching events), creating, updating, and deleting events via natural language commands.
*   **Synchronization Testing:** Validate accurate and timely synchronization of events between Outlook and Taskly.chat (bidirectional, if applicable, for updates).
*   **AI/NLP Testing:** Test a wide range of natural language queries for contextual understanding ('Do I have free slots?'), and command interpretation ('Block out an hour for X next Monday').
*   **Security Testing:** Verify secure token storage, data encryption, and adherence to privacy standards (e.g., proper scope usage).
*   **Performance Testing:** Assess latency for calendar data retrieval and event creation.
*   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Conduct scenario-based testing from a user's perspective to ensure seamless workflow integration.
