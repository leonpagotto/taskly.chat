Design how calendar-related information and actions will be presented and managed within the conversational interface of Taskly.chat.
*   Define visual templates for displaying upcoming events or available time slots within the chat bubble.
*   Design interaction patterns for confirming event creation or modification (e.g., showing a summary before saving).
*   Determine how the AI will prompt for missing information when creating an event (e.g., 'What's the title of the event?').
*   Ensure a consistent and natural user experience for calendar queries and commands.
