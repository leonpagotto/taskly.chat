Develop the backend logic required to establish and manage secure OAuth 2.0 connections with Microsoft Graph API for Outlook Calendar.
*   Register Taskly.chat as an application in Azure AD to obtain client ID and secret.
*   Implement `/oauth/outlook/initiate` endpoint to redirect users to Microsoft's authorization URL.
*   Develop `/oauth/outlook/callback` endpoint to handle the authorization code, exchange it for access and refresh tokens, and securely store these tokens in the database.
*   Implement a robust token refresh mechanism to maintain continuous access without requiring re-authentication.
*   Ensure all token storage and transmission adhere to strict security best practices (e.g., encryption at rest).
