Define the overall technical architecture for integrating Outlook Calendar, encompassing OAuth 2.0 flow, data synchronization strategy (e.g., polling intervals, webhook consideration), data storage mechanisms, and the design of necessary backend APIs. This includes:
*   Choosing between push notifications (webhooks) or periodic polling for event synchronization.
*   Defining the scope and structure of data to be stored locally (e.g., event ID, title, start/end, attendees).
*   High-level API endpoint design for connecting, synchronizing, reading, and writing calendar data.
