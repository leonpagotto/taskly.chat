Design and implement the necessary backend services and database schema to efficiently store, synchronize, and manage Outlook calendar data.
*   Design PostgreSQL schema for `user_outlook_calendars` and `outlook_events` tables, including fields for event ID, title, description, start/end times, organizer, recurrence rules, etc.
*   Develop initial full synchronization logic when a user first connects their Outlook account.
*   Implement incremental synchronization (e.g., using Microsoft Graph change notifications/webhooks or a scheduled polling mechanism) to keep Taskly.chat data up-to-date.
*   Develop a strategy for conflict resolution when changes occur simultaneously in Outlook and Taskly.chat.
*   Expose secure REST API endpoints for the frontend to query and manipulate user's synchronized calendar data.
