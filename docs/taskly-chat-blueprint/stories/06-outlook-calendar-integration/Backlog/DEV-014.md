title: Develop AI-Driven Calendar Action Generation and Confirmation
responsibleArea: AI/ML Engineer
---
Implement the AI logic responsible for generating appropriate responses and initiating calendar actions based on user input and extracted calendar context.
*   Formulate natural language responses that answer calendar queries or propose new events (e.g., 'Yes, you have a free slot from 2 PM to 3 PM,' or 'I can schedule 'Deep Work' for next Monday from 9 AM to 10 AM, does that sound right?').
*   Translate parsed natural language commands into structured API calls to the backend calendar creation/update endpoints.
*   Implement a confirmation mechanism, allowing the user to review and approve proposed calendar changes before they are committed to Outlook.
*   Handle edge cases and clarifications for ambiguous or incomplete calendar commands.
