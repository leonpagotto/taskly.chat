Enhance Taskly.chat's AI to interpret and utilize synchronized Outlook calendar data for contextual understanding and natural language processing.

*   Develop sophisticated NLP models or prompt engineering strategies to accurately interpret user queries like 'Do I have any free slots tomorrow?' or 'When is my next meeting with Alex?'
*   Implement entity extraction logic to identify key details (e.g., date, time, duration, attendees, title) from natural language commands such as 'Block out an hour for deep work next Monday morning.'
