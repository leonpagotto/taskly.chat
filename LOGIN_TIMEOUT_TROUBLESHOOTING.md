## üéØ Common Causes & Solutions

### Cause 1: Email Confirmation Still Required ‚ö†Ô∏è MOST COMMON

**Symptoms:**
- Timeout after exactly 10 seconds
- No error in Supabase Auth Logs
- Sign up works but creates no session

**Solution:**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qaemzribxkcvjhldpyto/auth/providers
2. Click "Email" provider
3. **UNCHECK** "Confirm email"
4. Click **Save**
5. **IMPORTANT**: Delete any test accounts you created while confirmation was enabled
6. Create a NEW account with the diagnostic tool or your app

**Why:** Even if you disable email confirmation, accounts created BEFORE you disabled it will still require confirmation!

### Cause 2: Email Rate Limits Hit üö´

**Symptoms:**
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Timeout specifically on authentication calls
- Works after waiting 1 hour

**Check:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qaemzribxkcvjhldpyto/logs/auth-logs
2. Look for "rate limit" errors

**Solution:**
- **Quick fix:** Wait 1 hour and try again
- **Permanent fix:** Configure custom SMTP (see `SUPABASE_AUTH_SETUP.md`)

---

### Cause 3: Project Paused or Network Issues üåê

**Symptoms:**
- Timeout on ALL Supabase calls (not just auth)
- Even database API times out

**Check:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qaemzribxkcvjhldpyto/settings/general
2. Check "Pause project" status

**Solution:**
- Resume project if paused
- Check your internet connection
- Try from a different network (mobile hotspot)
- Check if corporate firewall is blocking Supabase

---

### Cause 4: Wrong Credentials or User Doesn't Exist üë§

**Symptoms:**
- Instant error (< 1 second), not timeout
- Error message: "Invalid login credentials"

**Solution:**
1. Use the diagnostic tool to **Sign Up** first
2. Then try **Sign In** with the same credentials
3. Make sure "Confirm email" is disabled BEFORE signing up

---

### Cause 5: Redirect URLs Not Configured üîó

**Symptoms:**
- Login works but redirects fail
- "Invalid redirect URL" errors

**Solution:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qaemzribxkcvjhldpyto/auth/url-configuration
2. Set **Site URL** to: `http://localhost:3002`
3. Add **Redirect URLs**: `http://localhost:3002/**`
4. Click **Save**

- [ ] **Run Network Tests** - Should show "‚úì Supabase reachable"
- [ ] **Test Database API** - Should show "‚úì Database connected"
- [ ] **Test Auth Endpoint** - Should show "‚úì Auth health endpoint: 200"
- [ ] **Check Auth Settings:**

## üîß Emergency Fixes

### If Nothing Works:

1. **Create a new Supabase project** (10 minutes):
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Create new project
   - Update `.env.local` with new URL and anon key
   - Disable email confirmation from the start
   - Test login

2. **Use local auth only** (temporary):
   - The app works without Supabase
   - Data stays in browser localStorage
   - Good for testing UI/features

3. **Check Supabase Status**:
   - https://status.supabase.com/
   - Verify no ongoing incidents

## üìä What the Logs Should Show

### Successful Sign In (< 2 seconds):
```
üîê [authService] signInWithPassword called
üîê [authService] Calling supabase.auth.signInWithPassword...
üîê [authService] Sign-in response received
üîê [authService] Sign-in successful
```

### Failed Sign In (timeout):
```
üîê [authService] signInWithPassword called
üîê [authService] Calling supabase.auth.signInWithPassword...
[10 seconds pass]
üîê [authService] Sign-in exception: Error: Sign in timed out after 10000ms
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Use the diagnostic tool FIRST** - it will pinpoint the exact issue
2. **Focus on email confirmation** - this is the #1 cause
3. **Check Supabase Auth Logs** - they show the real errors
4. **If all else fails** - create a new Supabase project with email confirmation disabled from the start

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always disable email confirmation for development**
2. **Use the diagnostic tool after ANY Supabase config change**
3. **Delete and recreate test accounts** after changing auth settings
4. **Configure custom SMTP** before going to production
5. **Monitor rate limits** in Supabase dashboard

---

## üÜò Still Not Working?

If you've tried everything:

1. Take a screenshot of the diagnostic tool results
2. Check the browser console for ALL errors
3. Go to Supabase ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí Auth Logs and check for errors
4. Share:
   - Diagnostic tool results
   - Browser console errors
   - Supabase Auth Log errors
   - What you've tried so far

---

**Remember:** The timeout happens because Supabase is WAITING for something (usually email confirmation). It's not a network issue - it's a configuration issue!
