## Tasks


### [ ] Design Search API Endpoint
- **Status:** To Do
- **Description:** Define the REST API endpoint specification for book search, including request parameters (query string, search_by: title|author|isbn) and response structure, considering pagination and relevant book data fields.

---

### [ ] Implement Backend Search API Endpoint
- **Status:** To Do
- **Description:** Develop the Node.js/Express.js backend API endpoint (e.g., `/api/books/search`) to receive search requests, parse parameters, and initiate calls to external book data APIs.

---

### [ ] Integrate with Google Books API for Search
- **Status:** To Do
- **Description:** Implement the logic within the backend to call the Google Books API for book search queries, mapping request parameters (title, author, ISBN) to Google Books API queries and parsing the results.

---

### [ ] Integrate with Open Library API for Search
- **Status:** To Do
- **Description:** Implement the logic within the backend to call the Open Library API for book search queries, mapping request parameters (title, author, ISBN) to Open Library API queries and parsing the results. Prioritize or combine results from multiple APIs if necessary.

---

### [ ] Develop Search Result Consolidation and Formatting
- **Status:** To Do
- **Description:** Create backend logic to consolidate and format search results from different external APIs into a consistent structure before returning them to the client. Ensure key fields like title, author, ISBN, and potentially cover image URL are present.

---

### [ ] Implement Search Results Caching (Backend)
- **Status:** To Do
- **Description:** Introduce a caching mechanism (e.g., Redis or in-memory cache) for frequently searched book queries or external API responses to reduce redundant external API calls and improve performance.

---

### [ ] Design Search Screen UI (Flutter)
- **Status:** To Do
- **Description:** Create the visual design for the book search screen in Flutter, including an input field for search queries, search button, and a designated area to display search results. Focus on an intuitive and clean user experience.

---

### [ ] Implement Search Input Field and Action (Flutter)
- **Status:** To Do
- **Description:** Develop the Flutter UI components for the search input field, handle user text input, and implement the trigger for search action (e.g., on submit or a dedicated search button).

---

### [ ] Implement Search Input Validation and Debouncing (Flutter)
- **Status:** To Do
- **Description:** Add client-side validation for search queries (e.g., minimum character length) and implement debouncing to optimize API calls as the user types in the search field.

---

### [ ] Integrate Frontend with Backend Search API (Flutter)
- **Status:** To Do
- **Description:** Connect the Flutter application's search screen to the backend `/api/books/search` endpoint, sending user queries and handling the asynchronous retrieval of search results.

---

### [ ] Display Search Results UI (Flutter)
- **Status:** To Do
- **Description:** Develop the Flutter UI components to effectively display the list of search results, including book title, author, and ISBN, along with a thumbnail cover image if available, using widgets like ListView or GridView.

---

### [ ] Implement Loading and Error States for Search (Flutter)
- **Status:** To Do
- **Description:** Provide clear visual feedback to the user during search operations (loading indicators) and implement robust error handling and display for failed search requests (e.g., network issues, API errors).
