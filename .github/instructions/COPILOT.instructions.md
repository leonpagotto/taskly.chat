# ðŸ¤– Copilot Instructions (Unified)

_Last updated: 2025-09-20_

This unified guide combines project context (vision, architecture, structure) with governance rules (spec â†’ plan â†’ tasks workflow) for any AI assistant or Copilot operating in this repository. Treat this document as the authoritative contract. If an instruction conflicts with these rules, escalate before proceeding.

---
## 1. Project Vision Summary
Taskly.chat is an AI-powered personal assistant blending conversation, persistent memory, and intelligent automation. It turns informal thoughts (ideas, reminders, goals) into structured, trackable actions via natural language. Long-term, it aims to be the central hub for managing life domainsâ€”personal and professionalâ€”offering proactive, context-aware support that keeps productivity meaningful and balanced.

---
## 2. High-Level Architecture (Conceptual)
- **Client Layer**: Web (React / Next.js) and future Mobile (React Native) for conversational + task UX.
- **API Gateway**: Unified ingress for authentication, routing, and request shaping.
- **Core Services**:
  - Conversational AI Service (LLM orchestration, instruction grounding, memory retrieval)
  - Memory Management Service (vector + structured memory persistence)
  - Automation & Reminders Service (scheduling, nudges, temporal reasoning)
  - Integration Service (thirdâ€‘party APIs: calendar, tasks, communication tools)
  - User & Collaboration Service (accounts, permissions, sharing, roles)
- **Data Layer**:
  - Relational DB (PostgreSQL) for canonical user, project, task, permission data
  - Vector Store (Pinecone / Weaviate) for semantic memory retrieval
  - Redis (caching, ephemeral session/context, possibly queue)
  - (Optional) NoSQL / blob storage for conversation transcripts & artifacts
- **Async Backbone**: Message queue or streaming bus (Kafka / RabbitMQ) for decoupled events and workflows.
- **Observability**: Logging, tracing, metrics (future add-on).

---
## 3. Core Tech Stack (Planned / Emerging)
- Frontend: React / Next.js (current), future React Native
- Backend: Node.js (service + gateway), Python (AI-heavy or model tooling)
- AI: OpenAI / local adapters, embedding + retrieval pipeline
- Infra: Docker + potential Kubernetes for multi-service deployment
- Auth: OAuth2.0 / OIDC, future granular permission model
- Realtime: WebSockets (conversation streaming, task updates)

---
## 4. Repository Knowledge Model (speca-chat authoritative model)
Canonical planning artifacts now live under `speca-chat/` (NOT the legacy `docs/` structure):
```
speca-chat/
  stories/
    story-<NNN>/
      story.yml          # Required minimal metadata (id, slug, title, status, created, summary)
      story.md           # Optional narrative / rationale
      tasks/
        <TASK-ID>.task.yml  # Canonical task metadata (authoritative)
        <TASK-ID>.task.md   # Optional extended design / notes
  board/
    <status>/<TASK-ID>.yml  # Generated references (DO NOT edit manually)
  scripts/                  # Validation, generation, reporting utilities
  artifacts/                # Lint / delta output (JSON/CSV)
```
Key shifts from legacy model:
- Tasks are YAML (`*.task.yml`) not markdown header blocks.
- Board state derives from each task's `status` field; generator produces mirror refs under `board/`.
- Status changes occur by editing `status:` in the task YAML then regenerating board refs (never hand-edit `board/`).
- Optional `.task.md` houses richer narrative; absence is acceptable.
Story folders use zeroâ€‘padded numbering: `story-001`, `story-002`, etc. `story.yml` holds structured metadata. Acceptance criteria live at task level, not in `story.yml`.
---
## 5. Golden Governance Rules
- Authoritative planning root: `speca-chat/`.
- Stories: `speca-chat/stories/story-<NNN>/story.yml` (+ optional `story.md`).
- Tasks: `speca-chat/stories/story-<NNN>/tasks/<TASK-ID>.task.yml` (optional `<TASK-ID>.task.md`).
- Board refs: `speca-chat/board/<status>/<TASK-ID>.yml` are generated only (run generator script).
- Task `status` enum drives board location; never edit board refs directly.
- All cross-task or story references live in `related:` arrays (flat) inside task YAML.
- Acceptance criteria mandatory & testable (no generic placeholders).
- On structural/process conflicts, escalate before proceeding.

---
## 6. Core Definitions
- **Story (story.yml)**: Structured capability metadata (id, slug, title, status, summary).
- **Story Narrative (story.md)**: Optional deeper context; not authoritative for schema.
- **Task ( *.task.yml )**: Atomic unit containing id, story reference, status, type, summary, acceptance list, related refs, optional notes.
- **Task Narrative (.task.md)**: Optional extended rationale / design notes.
- **Board Ref**: Generated mirror of a task's id+status+story for status dashboards.

---
## 7. Request Handling Flow (Agent Algorithm)
1. Classify intent: feature | bug | chore | research | spike (reserved) | refactor (map to feature/chore if schema restricts).
2. Semantic search: scan `speca-chat/stories/story-*/tasks/*.task.yml` for matching summaries or acceptance terms; also consider story slugs.
3. If suitable task found & not `done` â†’ update its YAML (notes/acceptance progression) and, if status change warranted, modify `status` then regenerate board.
4. If only a story match â†’ create a new `<PREFIX-NNN>.task.yml` under that story's `tasks/`.
5. If no story match â†’ run Spec Kit (Section 8) to create a new story + initial tasks.
6. Ambiguous results â†’ present ranked candidates (id, summary) and request confirmation.
7. After implementing a task change: run validation + board generation scripts (Section 13) before committing.

---
## 8. Spec Kit Workflow (New Story Path)
1. Allocate next `story-<NNN>` (zero-padded) not already present.
2. Create `story.yml` with: `id`, `slug`, `title`, `status: backlog`, `created`, `summary`.
3. (Optional) Author `story.md` capturing problem, rationale, risks, relationships.
4. Derive initial implementation steps â†’ create one YAML task per step (Section 10) with `status: backlog`.
5. Run: board generation + validation.
6. Promote story `status` to `active` once at least one task moves beyond backlog.

---
## 9. Task Status Semantics
Enumerated task statuses (YAML `status` field): `backlog`, `todo`, `in-progress`, `review`, `done`.
Lifecycle rules:
- Forward-only progression (no direct `backlog` â†’ `done`).
- Status change requires justification added to `notes:` or `.task.md` (include date stamp).
- `done` tasks are immutable except for metadata corrections (never rewrite acceptance history).

---
## 10. Task YAML Canonical Template
```
# <TASK-ID>.task.yml
id: DEV-001
story: story-005
status: backlog            # backlog|todo|in-progress|review|done
type: feature              # feature|bug|chore|research|spike (if supported)
created: 2025-09-20
updated: 2025-09-20        # managed by timestamp script (omit if not set)
owner: team                # optional
related:                   # optional flat list
  - IMP-201
summary: Short imperative summary.
acceptance:
  - User can perform X via Y.
  - System persists Z under condition C.
notes: |
  Design rationale, context, progress journal entries with date prefixes.
```

Optional extended narrative/design: `<TASK-ID>.task.md` (freeform). Prefer logging significant scope clarifications with date stamps there or in `notes:`.

---
## 11. Relationship & De-Dup Strategy
De-dup algorithm:
1. Search existing `summary` + acceptance lines across tasks for overlapping nouns/verbs.
2. If enhancement of existing scope, add new acceptance to THAT task only if still atomic; else create a sibling task referencing original via `related:`.
3. Only create a new story if conceptual surface area (user goal set) is distinct from all existing stories.
4. Maintain reciprocity manually for now (validator warns on missing back-links); do not auto-add without confirmation.
Reference format: plain task IDs (e.g., `DEV-001`); story references not embedded inside `related:`â€”use only task IDs unless cross-story linking is essential.

---
## 12. Working a Task (Agent Behavior)
1. Open the task's `.task.yml` and update `notes:` with a dated entry describing intent before code changes.
2. Adjust `status:` when moving stages; then run board generation.
3. Evolve acceptance only by appending new items (timestamp rationale in `notes:`) â€” never delete satisfied lines; mark satisfaction by rewriting acceptance item text ONLY if clarifying (do not append checkboxes; criteria remain declarative statements).
4. If scope grows beyond atomic boundaries, split into a new task and link both via `related:`.
5. Do not manually edit generated board refs.
6. Prefer running timestamp script instead of hand-editing `updated:`.

---
## 13. Validation, Tooling & Review Gates
Scripts (run via `pnpm` or `node`):
- `speca-chat/scripts/generate-board.mjs` â†’ sync `board/` with current task statuses.
- `speca-chat/scripts/validate-structure.mjs` â†’ AJV schema + related existence + acceptance heuristics.
- `speca-chat/scripts/report-status-delta.mjs` â†’ legacy vs current drift (export JSON/CSV with `--out`).
- `speca-chat/scripts/update-task-timestamps.mjs` â†’ manage `updated:` fields.
- `speca-chat/scripts/lint-acceptance.mjs` â†’ detailed acceptance quality report (`artifacts/acceptance-lint-report.json`).

Review readiness criteria (before setting `status: review`):
- Acceptance statements reflect implemented observable outcomes.
- No placeholder / weak verb warnings outstanding (or justified in notes).
- Related references reciprocal where meaningful.
- Validation script completes with zero errors (warnings acceptable if documented).

---
## 14. Follow-Ups & Scope Creep
`done` tasks remain immutable (except metadata fix). New discoveries â†’ new tasks referencing original via `related:`. Aggregate multiple minor improvements into one chore task enumerating them in notes.

---
## 15. Future Automation (Roadmap)
- Acceptance auto-fix suggestions & severity tiers (promote certain heuristics to errors).
- Owner normalization enforcement.
- Ordering weights for board columns.
- Extended schema fields (effort, risk, labels, blockedBy/blocks).
- Reciprocal related auto-suggestion patch generator.

---
## 16. Escalation Protocol
On conflicting human instruction:
1. Quote the specific rule or schema requirement.
2. Request explicit override acknowledgment.
3. Log override rationale in the affected task's `notes:` with date.

---
## 17. Quick Agent Checklist
- Intent classified?
- Story located or new required?
- Task exists or needs creation?
- Acceptance clear & testable?
- Status accurate (`status:` field)?
- Board regenerated?
- Validation run (errors = 0)?
- Notes updated with date?
- Related reciprocity checked?

---
## 18. Minimal Operational Examples
- Incremental feature: Add `<PREFIX-NNN>.task.yml` (status backlog) â†’ implement â†’ set status `in-progress` â†’ generate board â†’ validate â†’ move to `review` then `done`.
- New capability: Spec Kit â†’ create `story.yml` + initial tasks â†’ activate first task.
- Refactor improvement: Create chore task; acceptance focuses on preserved behavior + metrics (e.g., bundle size reduced X%).
- Post-completion follow-up: New task referencing original via `related:` both directions.

---
## 19. Scope Boundaries (Out of Band)
Do NOT:
- Hand-edit files under `speca-chat/board/`.
- Remove historical acceptance lines (replace only to clarify, never erase intent).
- Fabricate owner or priority fields not yet standardized.
- Introduce new schema fields without updating this document & validator.

---
## 20. Summary Mantra
Search â†’ Match or Spec â†’ Create YAML Task â†’ Edit Status â†’ Generate Board â†’ Validate â†’ Commit (with dated notes & links).

Adherence ensures auditability, incremental evolution, and coherent collaboration between humans and agents.
