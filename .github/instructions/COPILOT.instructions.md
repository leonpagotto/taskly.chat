# ü§ñ Copilot Instructions (Unified)

_Last updated: 2025-09-19_

This unified guide combines project context (vision, architecture, structure) with governance rules (spec ‚Üí plan ‚Üí tasks workflow) for any AI assistant or Copilot operating in this repository. Treat this document as the authoritative contract. If an instruction conflicts with these rules, escalate before proceeding.

---
## 1. Project Vision Summary
Taskly.chat is an AI-powered personal assistant blending conversation, persistent memory, and intelligent automation. It turns informal thoughts (ideas, reminders, goals) into structured, trackable actions via natural language. Long-term, it aims to be the central hub for managing life domains‚Äîpersonal and professional‚Äîoffering proactive, context-aware support that keeps productivity meaningful and balanced.

---
## 2. High-Level Architecture (Conceptual)
- **Client Layer**: Web (React / Next.js) and future Mobile (React Native) for conversational + task UX.
- **API Gateway**: Unified ingress for authentication, routing, and request shaping.
- **Core Services**:
  - Conversational AI Service (LLM orchestration, instruction grounding, memory retrieval)
  - Memory Management Service (vector + structured memory persistence)
  - Automation & Reminders Service (scheduling, nudges, temporal reasoning)
  - Integration Service (third‚Äëparty APIs: calendar, tasks, communication tools)
  - User & Collaboration Service (accounts, permissions, sharing, roles)
- **Data Layer**:
  - Relational DB (PostgreSQL) for canonical user, project, task, permission data
  - Vector Store (Pinecone / Weaviate) for semantic memory retrieval
  - Redis (caching, ephemeral session/context, possibly queue)
  - (Optional) NoSQL / blob storage for conversation transcripts & artifacts
- **Async Backbone**: Message queue or streaming bus (Kafka / RabbitMQ) for decoupled events and workflows.
- **Observability**: Logging, tracing, metrics (future add-on).

---
## 3. Core Tech Stack (Planned / Emerging)
- Frontend: React / Next.js (current), future React Native
- Backend: Node.js (service + gateway), Python (AI-heavy or model tooling)
- AI: OpenAI / local adapters, embedding + retrieval pipeline
- Infra: Docker + potential Kubernetes for multi-service deployment
- Auth: OAuth2.0 / OIDC, future granular permission model
- Realtime: WebSockets (conversation streaming, task updates)

---
## 4. Repository Knowledge Model (File-Based Process)
Primary domain knowledge and workflow artifacts live under: `docs/taskly-chat/`
Primary domain knowledge and workflow artifacts live under: `docs/`
- `stories/<number>-<slug>/story.md` ‚Üí Story root specification
- `stories/<number>-<slug>/Backlog/` ‚Üí Story-scoped ideation tasks
- Global task pipeline: `tasks/{todo,in-progress,review,done}/` (single canonical flow)
- `docs/SPEC-INDEX.md` (auto-generated) ‚Üí Catalog of backlog counts + pipeline snapshot

Story numbering is ascending; slugs are stable. Tasks are single markdown files whose location (folder) = state.

5. Global pipeline folders are the single source of truth for active Task state (`tasks/*`). Story Backlog holds only unpulled tasks.
6. Only Task files move; Story roots (`story.md`) and constitutional/reference docs remain stationary.
6. Only Task files move; Story roots (`story.md`) and reference docs remain stationary.
---
## 5. Golden Governance Rules
- Specs & Stories: `stories/*/story.md`
- Story Backlog Tasks: `stories/*/Backlog/*.md`
- Active Tasks: `tasks/{todo,in-progress,review,done}/*.md`
- Process Reference: `docs/PROCESS.md`
- Copilot Context: `.github/instructions/COPILOT.instructions.md`
5. Folder path = single source of truth for Task state (Backlog ‚Üí InProgress ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Done).
6. Only Task files move; Story roots (`story.md`) and constitutional/reference docs remain stationary.
7. If any directive conflicts with these rules, pause and escalate.

---
## 6. Core Definitions
- **Spec**: Narrative rationale + scope + acceptance criteria (embodied in `story.md`).
- **Story**: Capability slice containing the governing spec and its task Kanban subfolders.
- **Plan**: Decomposition from acceptance criteria into implementable Tasks.
- **Task**: Atomic unit of work (one markdown file) that progresses across status folders.

---
## 7. Request Handling Flow (Agent Algorithm)
1. Classify intent: feature | bug | refactor | research | chore.
2. Search active Story folders for matching semantics.
3. If Task exists ‚Üí move to `InProgress/` (if not already) + append progress log.
4. If only Story matches ‚Üí create a new Task in its `Backlog/`.
5. If no match ‚Üí initiate Spec Kit (Section 8).
6. If ambiguous candidates ‚Üí propose list and request confirmation.
7. After completion ‚Üí enforce lifecycle transitions (Section 9).

---
## 8. Spec Kit Workflow (Creation Path)
1. Create new Story folder: `stories/<next-seq>-<kebab-slug>/` with `story.md` containing:
   - Header: Title, Date, Status: Draft, Owner (if known)
   - Summary / Problem / Rationale
   - Goals & Non-Goals
   - Acceptance Criteria (checkbox list)
   - Risks / Open Questions
   - Relationships (links to existing stories/tasks)
2. Add Plan section or `plan.md` enumerating implementation steps.
3. Generate initial Task files (one per step) in `Backlog/`.
4. Update Story status: Draft ‚Üí Planned once Tasks exist.

---
## 9. Kanban State Semantics
- `Backlog/`: Ideated; unstarted.
- `InProgress/`: Actively implemented; only one primary assignee context at a time.
- `Review/`: Code / logic complete; awaiting validation or integration.
- `Done/`: Accepted; immutable except for retrospective notes.

Transition invariants:
- Cannot skip states (Backlog ‚Üí Done prohibited).
- Each move requires a timestamped Progress Log entry.

---
## 10. Task File Canonical Template
```
# Task: <Concise Title>
Status: Backlog | InProgress | Review | Done
Story: <story-number-slug>
Created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
Updated: <YYYY-MM-DD>
Type: feature | bug | refactor | research | chore
Related: [story:<id>], [task:<id>], ...
Owner: <name-or-empty>

## Summary
<short purpose>

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Implementation Notes
- Initial design notes

## Progress Log
- <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> Created.
```

---
## 11. Relationship & De-Dup Strategy
Before creating a Task or Story:
1. Search keywords (functional nouns + verbs) across existing Story slugs and Task titles.
2. If overlapping scope: reference and extend instead of duplicating.
3. If incremental capability: new Task under existing Story.
4. Only create a new Story if conceptual boundary is distinct.

Notation guidelines:
- Stories: `[story:03-ai-personalization-based-on-memory]`
- Tasks: `[task:03/memory-index-refactor]`
- Maintain reciprocal `Related:` entries whenever possible.

---
## 12. Working a Task (Agent Behavior)
1. Ensure file resides in `InProgress/` before modifying code tied to it.
2. Append progress entries; never delete historical lines.
3. Keep Implementation Notes additive (delta oriented).
4. On completion: check all acceptance boxes; move to `Review/`.
5. When validated/merged: move to `Done/` + closing log entry.

---
## 13. Review Gate Criteria
A Task may move to `Review/` only when:
- Acceptance Criteria all satisfied
- Relevant code/tests pushed or described
- No unresolved ‚ÄúTBD‚Äù markers

Reviewers may add a `## Review` section with feedback. Rejection returns Task to `InProgress/` with rationale logged.

---
## 14. Follow-Ups & Scope Creep
Post-Done discoveries spawn new Tasks (never reopen Done). For clusters of micro follow-ups, create a meta Task referencing them as subtasks.

---
## 15. Future Automation (Not Yet Assumed)
- Linting: Validate Task header schema
- Index generation: Auto-build/update `SPEC-INDEX.md`
- Orphan detection: Tasks without Story linkage
- Cross-reference integrity checker

---
## 16. Escalation Protocol
On conflicting human instruction:
1. Identify violated rule (quote it)
2. Request explicit override
3. Proceed only after confirmation with an override log entry

---
## 17. Quick Agent Checklist
- Map request? (Y/N)
- If N ‚Üí Spec Kit
- Existing or new Task? (create if missing)
- Status correct? (move if needed)
- Relationships updated?
- Progress logged?

---
## 18. Minimal Operational Examples
- Create incremental feature: Add Task to existing Story Backlog ‚Üí move to InProgress ‚Üí implement ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Done.
- New capability: Run Spec Kit ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Backlog Tasks.
- Related improvement: Add Task + `Related:` reference to originating Task.

---
## 19. Scope Boundaries (Out of Band)
Do not:
- Modify unrelated Stories while working a single Task.
- Invent architecture beyond listed conceptual services without Spec.
- Remove historical log entries.

---
## 20. Summary Mantra
Map ‚Üí Extend or Spec ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Task ‚Üí Flow States ‚Üí Log ‚Üí Link.

Adherence ensures auditability, incremental evolution, and coherent collaboration between humans and agents.
