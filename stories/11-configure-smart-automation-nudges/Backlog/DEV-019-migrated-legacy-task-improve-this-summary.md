responsibleArea: AI/Machine Learning Engineer

Implement the backend services responsible for evaluating conditions for 'nudges,' 'insights,' and 'progress tracking' based on user configurations and task data. This task includes:
*   Designing and implementing a scheduling mechanism to periodically check task statuses and user-defined conditions.
*   Integrating with the user's stored nudge preferences to determine which nudges are active and their specific criteria (e.g., 'overdue for 2 days').
*   Developing the logic to query relevant data from the system (e.g., active tasks, deadlines, completion status) to identify trigger events.
*   Lobe Automation Spec: Utilizing AI/ML capabilities to generate 'smart' insights or contextually relevant 'nudges' where applicable, moving beyond simple rule-based triggers.
