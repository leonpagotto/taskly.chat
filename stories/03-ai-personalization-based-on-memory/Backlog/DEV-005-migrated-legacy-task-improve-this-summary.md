responsibleArea: Quality Assurance Engineer

Create comprehensive test suites to ensure the memory system functions correctly. This includes:
- **Unit tests:** For NLP extraction logic, database CRUD operations, and embedding generation.
- **Integration tests:** To verify the end-to-end flow from conversation ingestion to memory storage (both structured and vector).
- **Retrieval tests:** To ensure that given a query, the correct relevant memories are retrieved from both databases.
- **Data integrity checks:** To ensure memories are stored and updated accurately.
