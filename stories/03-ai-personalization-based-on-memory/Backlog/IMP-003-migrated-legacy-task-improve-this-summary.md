title: Implement NLP models for extracting personal memories from conversations
responsibleArea: AI/Machine Learning Engineer
---
Develop and integrate NLP models capable of identifying and extracting key personal information from user conversations. This involves:
- Training/fine-tuning models for named entity recognition (NER) to identify routines, preferences, priorities, and dates.
- Developing intent classification models to understand the user's intention related to memory (e.g., "set a reminder", "state a preference").
- Implementing logic to convert extracted raw text into structured data points matching the defined memory schema.
