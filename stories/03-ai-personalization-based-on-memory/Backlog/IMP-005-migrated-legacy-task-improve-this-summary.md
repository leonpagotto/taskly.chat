title: Implement contextual memory retrieval service
responsibleArea: AI/Machine Learning Engineer
---
Develop a service that can efficiently retrieve relevant memories based on the current user conversation. This involves:
- Processing the current user query to generate its embedding.
- Querying the vector database for semantically similar past interactions/memories.
- Querying PostgreSQL for structured facts (routines, dates, preferences) relevant to the current conversation context.
- Aggregating and ranking the retrieved memories to provide the most relevant context for the AI model.
