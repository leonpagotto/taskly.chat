Modify the AI inference pipeline to include retrieved user memories in the prompt provided to the Large Language Model (LLM). This includes:
- Designing a prompt engineering strategy to effectively inject memory data without overwhelming the LLM.
- Ensuring the memory context is appropriately formatted and prioritized within the prompt.
- Testing the impact of memory injection on AI response quality and relevance.
