responsibleArea: AI/Machine Learning Engineer
---
Develop or fine-tune an NLP model capable of parsing natural language user input to extract task-relevant information and assign the correct category (personal/professional). This includes:
*   Training the model to identify task title, description, due dates, priority, and status from free-form text.
*   Specifically focusing on accurately classifying tasks as 'personal' or 'professional' based on linguistic cues and contextual understanding.
*   Providing an API endpoint for the backend to consume, returning structured task data from free-form text.
