Develop the React frontend component(s) to display the unified list of tasks as per the UX/UI design. This includes:
*   Creating a responsive component that fetches tasks from `/api/tasks`.
*   Implementing UI elements for filtering tasks by category (personal/professional), status, and due date.
*   Adding sorting capabilities (e.g., by due date, priority).
*   Displaying task details in an easily digestible format.
*   Providing quick actions (e.g., mark as complete, edit, delete).
