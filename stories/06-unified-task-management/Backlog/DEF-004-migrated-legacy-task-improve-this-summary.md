Clearly define the data structure for tasks, including required fields, data types, and specific rules for distinguishing and managing personal vs. professional tasks. This includes:
*   Identifying core attributes like title, description, due date, priority, status, and category (personal/professional).
*   Defining validation rules for each attribute.
*   Specifying how 'personal' and 'professional' categories will be enforced and utilized in the UI and backend logic.
