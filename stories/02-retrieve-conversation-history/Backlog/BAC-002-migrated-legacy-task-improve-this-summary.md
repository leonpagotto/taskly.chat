title: Backend API for Retrieving Conversation History
responsibleArea: Full-stack Software Engineer
---
Implement a backend API endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/history` or `GET /api/v1/threads/{threadId}/history`) to fetch a paginated list of conversation messages for a given project or thread. The API should return messages in chronological order.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   API endpoint is authenticated and authorized, allowing users to only access their own history.
    *   Retrieves messages ordered by timestamp (oldest to newest by default, or configurable).
    *   Supports pagination parameters (e.g., `limit`, `offset`, or cursor-based) for efficient data loading.
    *   Filters messages correctly based on the provided project or thread ID.
    *   Returns an empty array if no conversation history exists for the specified context.
