title: Integrate Conversation History into AI Context Window
responsibleArea: AI/Machine Learning Engineer
---
Enhance the AI system to effectively utilize the stored conversation history when generating new responses. This involves retrieving relevant past messages from the persistent memory (e.g., vector database or recent chronological history from PostgreSQL) and incorporating them into the AI model's context window to maintain coherent and context-aware interactions.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   AI model's prompt generation mechanism includes a configurable number of recent past messages.
    *   System can retrieve relevant conversational snippets efficiently (e.g., from Pinecone/Weaviate for semantic search, or a fixed window from PostgreSQL).
    *   Demonstrably improved contextual understanding and response generation by the AI, as verified through testing scenarios.
