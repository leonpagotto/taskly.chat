title: Frontend Component for Displaying Conversation History
responsibleArea: Full-stack Software Engineer
---
Develop a reusable React frontend component responsible for fetching and displaying the conversation history for a selected project or thread. This component will consume the backend retrieval API and render messages in a user-friendly, chronological format.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Component integrates with the backend API to retrieve conversation history.
    *   Messages are clearly displayed with sender identification (e.g., 'You', 'Taskly AI') and timestamps.
    *   Handles loading states, error states, and gracefully displays when no history is available.
    *   Implements pagination or infinite scrolling for large conversation histories.
    *   Ensures responsive display across different screen sizes.
