title: Conduct End-to-End Testing for Project Collaboration Permissions
responsibleArea: Quality Assurance Engineer
---
Perform end-to-end testing to ensure the entire collaboration permissions feature functions correctly from the user's perspective, covering both frontend and backend interactions.
- A user can successfully add a collaborator with 'read-only' access and verify they cannot edit content.
- A user can successfully change a collaborator's role from 'read-only' to 'edit' and verify they can now edit content.
- A user can successfully remove a collaborator and verify they no longer have access to the project.
- Security checks are validated to ensure unauthorized users cannot bypass permission restrictions.
- Performance is acceptable when managing multiple collaborators.
