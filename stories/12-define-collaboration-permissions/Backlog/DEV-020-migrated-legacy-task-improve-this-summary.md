Implement RESTful API endpoints for managing collaborators and their assigned roles within a project.
- `POST /projects/{projectId}/collaborators`: Add a user as a collaborator with a specified role.
- `PUT /projects/{projectId}/collaborators/{userId}`: Update an existing collaborator's role.
- `DELETE /projects/{projectId}/collaborators/{userId}`: Remove a collaborator from a project.
- `GET /projects/{projectId}/collaborators`: Retrieve a list of all collaborators and their roles for a project.
- API endpoints are secured and require appropriate authentication and authorization (e.g., only project owner or admin can modify permissions).
