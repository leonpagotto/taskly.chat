Build the user interface components in React for displaying, adding, editing, and removing project collaborators and their roles.
- A `CollaboratorsList` component displays current collaborators, their roles, and options to edit/remove.
- An `AddCollaborator` component allows searching for users and assigning an initial role.
- A `RoleSelector` component enables changing a collaborator's role with available options.
- All components are responsive and integrate seamlessly into the project settings page.
- UI reflects the designs provided by the UX/UI Designer.
