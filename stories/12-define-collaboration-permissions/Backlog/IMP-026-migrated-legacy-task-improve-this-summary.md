responsibleArea: Full-stack Software Engineer
---
Develop and integrate logic across backend services to enforce collaboration permissions for project content (e.g., tasks, notes, goals).
- When a user attempts to view project content, their role is checked; 'read-only' users can view.
- When a user attempts to modify or create content within a project, their role is checked; 'edit' and 'administer' roles can perform these actions.
- 'Administer' role can manage collaborators and project settings.
- Unauthorized actions return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 403 Forbidden).
