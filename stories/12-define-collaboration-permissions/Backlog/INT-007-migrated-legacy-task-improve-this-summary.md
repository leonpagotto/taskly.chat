title: Integrate Frontend with Backend APIs for Collaborator Management
responsibleArea: Full-stack Software Engineer
---
Connect the frontend UI components with the newly developed backend APIs for collaborator and role management.
- Frontend can fetch the list of collaborators for a project and display their roles.
- Frontend can successfully send requests to add a new collaborator, update a collaborator's role, and remove a collaborator.
- Loading states, success messages, and error notifications are handled gracefully on the frontend.
- Consider real-time updates if WebSockets are deemed necessary for this feature.
