title: Design and Implement Database Schema for Project Collaboration Permissions
responsibleArea: Full-stack Software Engineer
---
Define and implement the necessary database schema changes to support project collaboration roles and associated permissions.
- A `roles` table exists, defining standard roles (e.g., 'read-only', 'edit', 'administer').
- A `project_collaborators` table links `projects`, `users`, and `roles`.
- Appropriate foreign key constraints and indices are defined for performance and data integrity.
- Database migrations are prepared and tested.
