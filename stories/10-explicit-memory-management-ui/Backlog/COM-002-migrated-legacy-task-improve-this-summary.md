Create and execute a detailed test plan for the explicit memory management UI and its backend APIs.
*   **Functional Testing:**
    *   Verify memory retrieval displays correct data.
    *   Verify memory editing correctly updates data in UI and backend.
    *   Verify memory deletion removes data from UI and backend.
    *   Test edge cases (empty memory list, very long memories).
    *   Test pagination/filtering.
*   **Integration Testing:**
    *   Confirm backend APIs interact correctly with PostgreSQL and Pinecone/Weaviate.
    *   Verify frontend UI correctly consumes backend APIs.
*   **Security Testing:**
    *   Ensure only authorized users can access/modify their own memories.
    *   Test for common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
*   **Performance Testing:**
    *   Evaluate API response times and UI responsiveness with varying memory loads.
*   **AI Impact Verification:**
    *   Confirm that 'forgotten' memories are no longer used by the AI in new interactions.
    *   Confirm edited memories are reflected in AI's responses.
