title: Design UI/UX for Global AI Instruction Settings
responsibleArea: UX/UI Designer
---
Design the user interface and interaction flow for users to set and manage their global AI instructions (e.g., preferred tone, default level of detail, specific constraints).
*   **Wireframes and Mockups:** Create visual designs for the settings page where users can input and view their global AI instructions.
*   **Input Fields:** Define appropriate input types and validation for various instruction parameters (e.g., text area for custom instructions, dropdown for tone, slider for detail level).
*   **User Flow:** Map out the user journey for accessing, modifying, saving, and canceling instruction changes.
*   **Feedback Mechanisms:** Design clear success and error messages for saving operations.
*   **Responsiveness:** Ensure the design is adaptive and consistent across different device sizes.
