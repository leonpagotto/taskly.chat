responsibleArea: Full-stack Software Engineer

Develop the frontend component for the global AI instruction settings page using React, based on the approved UX/UI designs.
*   **UI Development:** Build the necessary React components to render the instruction settings page.
*   **Input Handling:** Implement controlled components for user input, including text areas, dropdowns, and sliders, mirroring the design specifications.
*   **Client-side Validation:** Add basic validation to input fields to provide immediate user feedback.
*   **API Integration:** Connect the frontend to the backend API to `GET` existing global instructions and `PUT` updated instructions.
*   **State Management:** Manage the UI state for instructions, including loading, saving, and error states.
*   **User Feedback:** Display appropriate success or error messages to the user after API calls.
