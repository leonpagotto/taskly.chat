Create a system to notify users about project shares and manage invitations.
*   **In-app Notifications**: Send real-time notifications to users when a project is shared with them or their permissions are changed.
*   **Email Invitations**: For sharing with users not yet registered or for persistent notifications, implement email invitation functionality.
*   **Invitation Acceptance Flow**: Design and implement a flow for invited users to accept or decline project invitations, updating their access status accordingly.
*   Ensure notifications are cleared or updated appropriately upon user action.
