# Story: 15-import-render-sync-tasks-stories

## Summary
Provide ingestion and rendering pipeline to import, parse, and sync external or local story/task sources into the system.

TODO: Explain need to bootstrap content and integrate existing planning artifacts.

## Open Questions
1. How frequently to poll or trigger sync?

## Related Stories / Tasks

## Narrative Notes
Phased approach: local ingestion prototype â†’ remote URL ingestion.
