summary: Enhance tagging with suggestions and normalization.
acceptance:
  - Tag normalization lowercases & trims; duplicates prevented.
  - Suggestions endpoint returns top tags by frequency (limit param) within userâ€™s memories.
  - Adding tag updates frequency counts for subsequent suggestions.
  - Removing tag decrements frequency; counts never drop below zero.
  - Bulk add tags to multiple selected memories endpoint processes <=50 ids.
  - Unit tests cover normalization, duplicate prevention, frequency updates.
