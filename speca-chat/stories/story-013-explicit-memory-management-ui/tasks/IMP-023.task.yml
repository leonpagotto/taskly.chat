title: Memory bulk operations efficiency
status: backlog
created: 2025-09-20
updated: 2025-09-20
type: feature
summary: Optimize bulk approve/delete/tag operations for up to 500 memories.
acceptance:
  - Bulk approve endpoint processes up to 500 IDs in <= 2 DB round trips (excluding audit inserts).
  - Bulk delete soft-deletes (sets deletedAt) and enqueues background vector store purge (placeholder event emission).
  - Bulk tag add/remove operations return per-id success/failure array.
  - Invalid ID handling does not abort entire batch; failures aggregated.
  - Performance test (script) demonstrates bulk approve of 500 averages < 1s locally.
  - Unit tests: partial failure scenario, empty list (400), max size boundary.
