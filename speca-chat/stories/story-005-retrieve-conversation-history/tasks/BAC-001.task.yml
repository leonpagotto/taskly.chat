status: backlog

updated: 2025-09-20
type: chore
acceptance:
  - Endpoint specification for conversation retrieval documented (path, params, pagination) in story notes.
  - Supports filtering by date range (start & end ISO timestamps) returning only messages within bounds.
  - Pagination uses cursor or ISO timestamp; response includes next cursor when more results exist.
  - Maximum page size enforced (<=100 messages) with default of 50 when size not provided.
  - Results sorted ascending by creation time; no duplicates across sequential page fetches.
  - 95th percentile response time for typical 30-day query under 400ms in local dev with seed data.
  - Returns structured JSON: { messages: [...], page: { nextCursor, hasMore } } with stable field names.
  - Invalid date range (start after end) returns 400 with machine-readable error code.
