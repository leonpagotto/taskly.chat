acceptance:
  - Integration test seeds at least 200 messages across >1 day span and validates full retrieval across pages.
  - Verifies auth enforcement (unauthorized attempt blocked) and rate limit path after threshold.
  - Confirms no duplicate message ids across sequential page fetches.
  - Validates timestamp ordering and boundary inclusion/exclusion logic (inclusive start, exclusive end documented).
  - Asserts performance budget: combined 3-page retrieval under 1.2s wall clock in test environment.
  - Test artifacts (seed script/log) stored or referenced for reproducibility.
