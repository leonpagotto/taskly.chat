type: chore
acceptance:
  - Conversation retrieval endpoint enforces per-user authorization (cannot access another user's messages).
  - Requests without valid auth token return 401; insufficient scope returns 403 with error code.
  - Rate limiting applied: more than 60 retrieval requests/minute per user returns 429 with retry-after header.
  - All access attempts logged with user id, time, page size, and filter usage (date range present?).
  - PII fields (if any) excluded or redacted per data classification policy (no raw access tokens, internal ids exposed).
  - Security unit tests cover auth success, unauthorized, forbidden, rate limit, and redaction scenarios.
