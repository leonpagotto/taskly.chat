type: chore
acceptance:
  - UX wireframe shows conversation history section with clear date boundaries & lazy load affordance.
  - Loading state skeleton distinct from empty state (empty explains no prior messages found for range).
  - Error state displays retry action & preserves previously loaded messages.
  - Infinite scroll or load-more button behavior defined (trigger threshold or button label, respectively).
  - Accessibility: history region labeled for screen readers and announces newly loaded batch count.
  - Timezone display clarified (shows local user time with relative time tooltip on hover/focus).
