type: chore
acceptance:
  - Frontend calls retrieval endpoint with correct query params (date range, cursor) only when user scroll/load-more action occurs.
  - Debounces rapid scroll triggers to max one request per 300ms.
  - Displays messages in chronological order; adding new page does not reorder existing DOM nodes unexpectedly.
  - Shows loading indicator while fetching next page; removed within 100ms of completion.
  - Handles 400/401/403/429 errors with distinct user feedback messages.
  - Unit or component tests cover success, empty, error, pagination continuation, and rate limit states.
