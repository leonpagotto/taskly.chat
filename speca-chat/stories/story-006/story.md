# Story: 03-ai-personalization-based-on-memory

## Summary
Persist and retrieve salient user preferences and facts so AI responses adapt over time with explicit memory controls.

## Motivation
Need for tailored responses vs generic assistant output.

## Desired Outcomes
- Memory store persists approved items.
- AI retrieval injects relevant memory on prompt build.

## Scope
In Scope:
- CRUD for explicit memories.

Out of Scope (Initial):
- Implicit auto-capture without user confirmation.

## Success Metrics
- % of responses enhanced by memory (tracked later).

## Risks
- Privacy concerns / over-retention.

## Assumptions
- User will curate memory quality.

## Open Questions
1. Memory TTL strategy?

## Related Stories / Tasks
- story-010 habit tracking (future data enrichment).

## Narrative Notes
Start with manual memory injection pipeline.

## Progress Log
- 2025-09-20 Narrative scaffold added; legacy draft replaced.
