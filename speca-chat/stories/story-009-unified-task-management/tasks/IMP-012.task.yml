title: Task search relevance tuning
status: backlog
created: 2025-09-20
updated: 2025-09-20
type: feature
summary: Improve text search relevance for tasks (title+description+tags).
acceptance:
  - Full text search implemented (e.g., PostgreSQL tsvector) combining title (weight A), tags (weight B), description (weight C) with documented weighting.
  - Search endpoint (?q=) returns results ordered by ts_rank with deterministic tiebreaker (createdAt desc).
  - Query with multi-term input returns tasks containing all terms unless quoted phrase used.
  - Partial term search (prefix) supported via trigram or GIN pending performance evaluation documented in notes.
  - Relevance test dataset (>=20 tasks) demonstrates higher relevance scores for exact title matches vs partial description matches.
  - Explain plan for search query shows index usage (GIN/GIST) without sequential scan on large dataset sample.
