title: External task import normalization
status: backlog
created: 2025-09-20
updated: 2025-09-20
type: feature
summary: Normalize imported tasks (e.g., Trello/Jira) into unified model.
acceptance:
  - Import function maps external fields (id, title/name, description, status, due) into model fields with deterministic source=imported.
  - Duplicate externalId within same source skipped with recorded skip count.
  - Status mapping table defined (external -> internal) and includes fallback to backlog for unmapped states; fallback occurrences counted.
  - Tag extraction parses external labels into tags preserving case normalization (lowercase unique) and de-duplicates.
  - Import summary returns counts: created, skippedDuplicates, unmappedStatuses, errors; errors array includes at least id + message.
  - Large batch (>=500 items) processed in streaming or chunked fashion without exceeding memory threshold (document measurement in notes).
  - Unit/integration test covers duplicate handling, unmapped status fallback, tag normalization.
