acceptance:
  - Command `pnpm extract:tasks` processes a sample message and outputs structured JSON with at least fields: id (temp), title, rawText.
  - Extraction returns an empty array (not error) for messages containing no actionable verbs.
  - Extraction runtime completes under 500ms for a 500-character message on local dev.
  - Invalid UTF-8 input is safely rejected with descriptive error (no crash).
  - Log line emitted with count of extracted task drafts.
