summary: Prototype function extracting task candidates from a freeform user message.
acceptance:
  - extractTasks(text) returns array of objects { title, confidence }.
  - Confidence is float 0-1 and >=0.7 for clear imperative sentences in test set (list documented examples).
  - Maximum tasks per input capped at 5; longer list truncated with note (boolean flag truncated=true) on result set.
  - Sentences containing scheduling words ("tomorrow", specific date) include them in title normalization.
  - Unit tests cover: multiple tasks in one sentence, no tasks case (empty array), truncation path.
