title: Instruction conflict adaptation logic
status: backlog
created: 2025-09-20

type: feature
summary: Determine precedence resolution when project instructions conflict with global instructions.
acceptance:
  - Precedence policy: project scope overrides global when referencing same behavioral dimension (dimension extracted via key phrase heuristics) documented in notes.
  - Conflict detector flags overlapping directives (e.g., tone: friendly vs tone: formal) and logs structured warning.
  - Adaptation function merges instructions returning ordered list: project-high, project-neutral, global-non-conflicting.
  - Unit tests cover conflicting tone, conflicting confidentiality directive, additive non-conflicting instructions.
  - Performance: merge executes < 2ms average for 20 instructions in benchmark test.
  - Output includes provenance metadata per instruction (source: global|project).
