summary: Ensure member list handles large projects efficiently.
acceptance:
  - Virtualized rendering strategy used when members > 50; verified by DOM node count < 60 for 500 members.
  - Search/filter input (by name/email) returns results under 150ms with 500 member dataset.
  - No layout shift > 0.02 when filtering.
  - Role change action on scrolled item preserves scroll position post-update.
  - Performance profile shows less than 5ms scripting time per scroll frame in large dataset scenario.
  - Memory leak test (navigate away & back 5x) shows no increase >5% retained nodes snapshot.
