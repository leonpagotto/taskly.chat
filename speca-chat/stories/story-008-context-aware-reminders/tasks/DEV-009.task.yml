acceptance:
  - Scheduler scans due active reminders every minute (configurable interval) without drifting >5s over 10 cycles.
  - Idempotency ensured: same reminder not fired twice within its window.
  - Execution records persisted (reminderId, firedAt) for audit.
  - Paused reminders skipped; disabled ignored.
  - Metrics collected: remindersChecked, remindersFired, skippedPaused, skippedDisabled.
  - Tests simulate firing, idempotency, pause/disable, timing drift.
