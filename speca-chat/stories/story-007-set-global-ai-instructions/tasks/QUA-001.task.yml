type: chore
acceptance:
  - Load test (synthetic) of 50 concurrent instruction updates completes with zero 500 errors.
  - Mutation error rate < 1% under simulated latency injection (200ms p95 DB delay) in test harness.
  - Prompt merge length never exceeds configured budget in tests; any overflows counted & asserted zero.
  - Static analysis/lint passes with no new warnings for instruction code paths.
  - Security review checklist completed (no logging of raw tokens, PII exposure avoided).
  - Test report stored or summarized in task notes.
