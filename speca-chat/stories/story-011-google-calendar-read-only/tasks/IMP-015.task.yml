title: Event fetch batching performance
status: backlog
created: 2025-09-20
updated: 2025-09-20
type: feature
summary: Optimize fetching events to minimize API calls and latency.
acceptance:
  - Batch request strategy limits to <=1 API call per distinct calendar during initial load.
  - Caching layer stores normalized events for 60s; repeated list within window hits cache (validated via instrumentation logs).
  - Average end-to-end fetch (network + normalization) < 800ms for 3 calendars with 50 events each in test harness.
  - Parallelization strategy documented (Promise.all or queue) and avoids exceeding Google rate limits.
  - Performance test script outputs timing metrics and is checked into repo.
  - Log includes event count + source calendars per fetch for observability.
