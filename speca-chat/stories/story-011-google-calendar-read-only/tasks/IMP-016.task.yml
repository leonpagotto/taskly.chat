title: Timezone & daylight savings accuracy
status: backlog
created: 2025-09-20
updated: 2025-09-20
type: feature
summary: Ensure events display correct local times across DST transitions.
acceptance:
  - Event normalization converts start/end to user profile timezone using IANA zone (no fixed offsets).
  - DST boundary test (event spanning transition) displays correct local wall times (document test case references).
  - Comparison against Google UI for sample DST event matches both start and end times.
  - Library choice for timezone handling documented (e.g., Luxon or date-fns-tz) with justification.
  - Unit tests include at least 2 zones with opposite DST rules (e.g., America/New_York, Europe/London).
  - No naive Date parsing of ISO strings without explicit zone handling (grep check included in notes).
