title: DEV-004
status: backlog
created: 2025-09-20
updated: 2025-09-20
type: chore
acceptance:
  - API for creating memory entry persists record and returns 201 with id & timestamps.
  - Validation errors return 400 with field-level error descriptors.
  - Duplicate suppression implemented (same content hash within 24h returns existing id) and documented.
  - Embedding generation queued asynchronously; create endpoint responds before vector write completion.
  - Observability: logs include memory id and source type at info level.
  - Unit tests cover create success, duplicate path, invalid payload, async embedding dispatch.
