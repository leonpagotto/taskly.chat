type: chore
acceptance:
  - Update endpoint allows modifying content and pinned flag only (other fields immutable) with optimistic concurrency (version or updatedAt check).
  - Attempt to modify immutable fields returns 400 with specific error code.
  - Conflict (stale version) returns 409 with guidance to refetch.
  - Audit log entry created for each update including changed fields.
  - Partial updates supported (omitted fields untouched) via PATCH semantics.
  - Tests cover success, immutable field attempt, stale conflict, partial update, audit logging.
