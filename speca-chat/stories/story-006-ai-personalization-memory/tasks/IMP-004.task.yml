type: chore
acceptance:
  - Ranking algorithm scores memories using recency decay + pin boost + type weight; formula documented.
  - Recency decay function parameters configurable (e.g., half-life) via environment or config file.
  - Pinned memories always appear above unpinned regardless of decay score.
  - Deterministic ordering for equal scores (tie-breaker by createdAt ascending or id).
  - Performance: ranking of 1000 candidate memories executes < 50ms in local dev.
  - Tests cover scoring formula, pin override, deterministic tie-break, configurable decay.
