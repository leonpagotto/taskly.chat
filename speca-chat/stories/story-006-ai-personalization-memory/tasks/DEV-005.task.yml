type: chore
acceptance:
  - Retrieval API returns prioritized list: pinned first, then recent (lastAccessedAt desc), capped at 100.
  - Supports filter by memory type; unsupported type param returns 400.
  - Response includes embedding availability flag (hasVector: boolean).
  - Access updates lastAccessedAt asynchronously (non-blocking to response time).
  - Average retrieval response < 150ms in local dev with 5k memory items.
  - Tests cover filter, ordering, cap enforcement, missing type, performance budget simulated.
