title: Rule execution performance tuning
status: backlog
created: 2025-09-20

type: feature
summary: Optimize rule evaluation throughput for high event volume.
acceptance:
  - Benchmark: 500 rules evaluated against event in < 250ms average (document hardware).
  - Hot paths profiled; at least one micro-optimization (e.g., precompiled predicate) implemented with measured gain.
  - Memory usage snapshot after 10k evaluations shows no sustained growth (>5% increase) indicating no leaks.
  - Caching layer introduced for static condition parsing reducing per-eval allocations (document improvement numbers).
  - Benchmark script committed with reproducible dataset.
  - Results recorded in notes including baseline vs optimized metrics.
