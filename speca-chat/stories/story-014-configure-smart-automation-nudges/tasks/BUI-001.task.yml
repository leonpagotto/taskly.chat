title: Rule builder UI foundational components
status: backlog
created: 2025-09-20
updated: 2025-09-20
type: feature
summary: Build reusable condition + action component primitives for automation rule authoring.
acceptance:
  - Components created: ConditionRow, ActionRow, ComparatorSelect, ValueInput, SchedulePicker.
  - Each component exposes typed props and emits onChange payload with shape { id, field, operator, value }.
  - ConditionRow supports field select (task.status, task.dueAt, memory.tag), operator select (auto changes list based on field type), value input (date picker for dueAt, multi-select for status).
  - ActionRow supports action types: sendReminder, addTag, setPriority; parameters validated (e.g., tag non-empty).
  - Storybook stories added for each component with at least default + interactive states.
  - Accessibility: all interactive elements reachable via keyboard, visible focus rings.
  - Unit tests cover operator list switching and value change emission.
