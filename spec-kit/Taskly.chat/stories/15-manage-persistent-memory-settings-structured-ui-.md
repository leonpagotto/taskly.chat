## Story: Manage Persistent Memory Settings (Structured UI)

**Description:**
As a user, I want a dedicated section within Taskly.chat's structured UI where I can view, edit, and manage the information stored in my persistent memory (e.g., my preferred weather location, list of known contacts, common routines, explicit preferences), so I have control over what Taskly.chat remembers about me. This UI should allow me to add, update, or remove entries from my persistent memory. For example, I should be able to manually add a contact, specify a new default weather location, or delete a shopping item that is no longer relevant.

### Tasks

- [ ] **Define Persistent Memory Schemas & Categories** [Product Manager]
  - Outline the initial data structures and categories for persistent memory entries. This includes specifying required fields, data types, and example values for each memory type (e.g., 'WeatherLocation' with fields for city/zip, 'Contact' with fields for name/phone/email, 'Routine' with name/time/frequency).
    *   Identify core memory types needed for MVP.
    *   Document schema for each memory type (fields, data types, constraints).
    *   Prioritize which memory types will be manageable via the structured UI in the initial release.
- [ ] **Design Persistent Memory Management UI** [UX/UI Designer]
  - Create wireframes and high-fidelity mockups for the dedicated 'Persistent Memory' section within Taskly.chat's structured UI.
    *   Design the overall layout for viewing, adding, editing, and deleting memory entries.
    *   Develop interaction flows for each CRUD operation.
    *   Specify input fields and UI components for different memory types (e.g., text inputs, dropdowns, date pickers).
    *   Design confirmation dialogs for deletion and success/error notifications.
    *   Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes.
- [ ] **Design Persistent Memory Database Schema** [Backend Engineer]
  - Define the PostgreSQL database tables and relationships required to store persistent memory entries. The schema should be flexible to accommodate different types of memory data.
    *   Create a `persistent_memory` table with fields like `id`, `user_id`, `type` (e.g., 'WeatherLocation', 'Contact'), `value` (JSONB for flexible data storage), `created_at`, `updated_at`.
    *   Ensure proper indexing for efficient querying.
    *   Establish foreign key relationship with the `users` table.
    *   Document the schema design.
- [ ] **Implement Persistent Memory Read API** [Backend Engineer]
  - Develop a NestJS API endpoint to retrieve all persistent memory entries for a specific user.
    *   Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/memory`.
    *   Require user authentication (JWT).
    *   Implement logic to fetch all entries belonging to the authenticated user from the database.
    *   Optionally, allow filtering by `type` (e.g., `GET /api/v1/memory?type=WeatherLocation`).
    *   Return a structured JSON array of memory objects.
- [ ] **Implement Persistent Memory Create API** [Backend Engineer]
  - Develop a NestJS API endpoint to add a new persistent memory entry for a user.
    *   Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/memory`.
    *   Require user authentication (JWT).
    *   Accept `type` and `value` (JSONB) in the request body.
    *   Implement server-side validation based on defined memory schemas.
    *   Store the new entry in the `persistent_memory` table, associating it with the authenticated user.
    *   Return the newly created memory object with its `id`.
- [ ] **Implement Persistent Memory Update API** [Backend Engineer]
  - Develop a NestJS API endpoint to update an existing persistent memory entry for a user.
    *   Endpoint: `PUT /api/v1/memory/:id`.
    *   Require user authentication (JWT).
    *   Accept updated `type` or `value` in the request body.
    *   Implement authorization to ensure the user can only update their own memory entries.
    *   Perform server-side validation on updated data.
    *   Update the corresponding entry in the `persistent_memory` table.
    *   Return the updated memory object.
- [ ] **Implement Persistent Memory Delete API** [Backend Engineer]
  - Develop a NestJS API endpoint to delete a persistent memory entry for a user.
    *   Endpoint: `DELETE /api/v1/memory/:id`.
    *   Require user authentication (JWT).
    *   Implement authorization to ensure the user can only delete their own memory entries.
    *   Remove the specified entry from the `persistent_memory` table.
    *   Return a success status or an empty response on successful deletion.
- [ ] **Integrate UI-Managed Memory into AI/NLP Model Context** [AI/NLP Engineer]
  - Ensure that persistent memory entries added/updated/deleted via the structured UI are accurately reflected and accessible by the AI/NLP models for contextual understanding and response generation.
    *   Modify the AI/NLP pipeline (e.g., LangChain orchestration) to fetch user's persistent memory data (via Backend API or direct DB access) at appropriate stages.
    *   Define the format and structure in which this memory is fed into the language models as part of their context window.
    *   Implement mechanisms to refresh or invalidate cached memory data when changes occur through the structured UI.
    *   Test conversational responses to verify AI utilizes manually updated memory (e.g., asking about weather in a new default location, referencing a newly added contact).
- [ ] **Create Persistent Memory Management Page** [Frontend Engineer]
  - Implement a new Next.js page that serves as the entry point for persistent memory management within the structured UI.
    *   Create a new route (e.g., `/settings/memory`) for the page.
    *   Set up the basic page layout, including header and potential navigation.
    *   Integrate the page into the application's overall navigation structure (e.g., a link in the settings sidebar).
- [ ] **Develop Persistent Memory List Component** [Frontend Engineer]
  - Build a React component to display a list of all persistent memory entries for the authenticated user.
    *   Fetch memory data from the Backend API (`GET /api/v1/memory`) upon component mount.
    *   Render each memory entry, clearly showing its type and value (e.g., 'Weather Location: New York', 'Contact: John Doe, 555-1234').
    *   Include interactive 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons/icons for each entry.
    *   Implement visual feedback for loading states, empty states, and errors during data fetching.
- [ ] **Develop Add/Edit Persistent Memory Form Components** [Frontend Engineer]
  - Create React components (e.g., modals or expandable forms) for adding new and editing existing persistent memory entries.
    *   Design forms to dynamically adapt input fields based on the selected memory `type`.
    *   Implement client-side validation for form inputs.
    *   Integrate with the Backend APIs (`POST /api/v1/memory` for add, `PUT /api/v1/memory/:id` for edit) upon form submission.
    *   Provide clear success and error messages to the user post-submission.
    *   Ensure forms pre-populate with existing data when editing.
- [ ] **Implement Persistent Memory Deletion Flow** [Frontend Engineer]
  - Implement the UI and associated logic for deleting a persistent memory entry.
    *   When the 'Delete' action is triggered, present a confirmation dialog to the user.
    *   Upon user confirmation, call the Backend API (`DELETE /api/v1/memory/:id`) to remove the entry.
    *   Update the displayed list of memory entries in the UI immediately after successful deletion.
    *   Handle and display any errors that occur during the deletion process.
