## Story: Accurate Natural Language Understanding for Task Capture

**Description:**
As a user, I want the AI to accurately understand a wide range of natural language expressions for task capture, including various phrasings for dates, times, task types, and recurring patterns, so my intentions are consistently translated into correct actions without requiring precise syntax. This includes handling synonyms, implied contexts, and variations in sentence structure. The AI should be able to differentiate between simple reminders, recurring tasks, shopping list items, and habit updates based on the conversational input and persistent memory.

### Tasks

- [ ] **Define NLU Intent & Entity Extraction Scope** [Product Manager]
  - Collaborate with the AI/NLP Engineer to define the precise scope of natural language understanding for task capture.
    *   Identify key intents (e.g., simple reminder, recurring task, shopping list item, habit update).
    *   Specify critical entities to extract (e.g., date, time, recurrence pattern, task description, context).
    *   Gather example phrasings, synonyms, and anticipated edge cases for each intent and entity.
    *   Establish initial accuracy benchmarks for the NLU model.
- [ ] **Research & Select Core NLU Libraries/Frameworks** [AI/NLP Engineer]
  - Evaluate existing NLP libraries and frameworks (e.g., spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, dateparser) within the Python FastAPI stack.
    *   Select the most suitable tools for Named Entity Recognition (NER), intent classification, and syntactic parsing.
    *   Document the chosen approach and provide justification for the selections.
- [ ] **Develop Custom Intent Classifier for Task Types** [AI/NLP Engineer]
  - Design and implement a machine learning model or rule-based system to accurately classify user input into distinct task types:
    *   Simple Reminder
    *   Recurring Task
    *   Shopping List Item
    *   Habit Update
    *   Train the model using diverse training data covering various phrasings and implied contexts.
    *   Evaluate model performance and iterate on improvements.
- [ ] **Implement Robust Date & Time Entity Extraction** [AI/NLP Engineer]
  - Integrate and configure a date/time parsing library (e.g., `dateparser`) or develop custom extraction rules.
    *   Ensure accurate extraction and normalization of various date and time expressions, including:
        *   Relative (e.g., "tomorrow", "next Monday", "in 3 days")
        *   Absolute (e.g., "December 25th", "2023-12-25")
        *   Ambiguous (e.g., "Friday" - resolve based on current date)
        *   Time expressions (e.g., "at 3 PM", "noon", "morning")
        *   Date ranges (e.g., "from Tuesday to Friday")
- [ ] **Implement Recurring Pattern Recognition Module** [AI/NLP Engineer]
  - Develop or integrate a module to identify and parse recurring patterns from natural language.
    *   Support various recurrence types:
        *   Daily ("every day")
        *   Weekly ("every Monday", "twice a week")
        *   Monthly ("on the 15th", "first Tuesday of the month")
        *   Yearly ("every year on my birthday")
        *   Interval-based ("every 3 days", "every other week")
    *   Normalize detected patterns into a structured format for storage.
- [ ] **Design & Implement NLU Service API** [Backend Engineer]
  - Collaborate to design the API endpoint(s) for the NLU service (FastAPI).
    *   Define request and response payloads:
        *   **Request:** User's raw natural language input, optional user context.
        *   **Response:** Structured JSON object containing parsed data such as `taskType`, `description`, `dueDate`, `dueTime`, `recurrencePattern`, and `entities`.
    *   Implement the API endpoint in FastAPI to expose the NLU capabilities.
- [ ] **Integrate NLU Service with Task Management Backend** [Backend Engineer]
  - Develop or extend the Task Management service (Node.js/NestJS) to consume the structured output from the NLU service API.
    *   Implement logic to transform the NLU output into the database schema for tasks, reminders, shopping items, and habit entries.
    *   Ensure robust data validation and error handling for NLU responses.
    *   Persist the structured task data to the PostgreSQL database.
- [ ] **Implement Context-Aware NLU Integration with Persistent Memory** [AI/NLP Engineer]
  - Develop mechanisms for the NLU model to leverage persistent memory (e.g., user preferences, previously discussed topics from Redis/PostgreSQL).
    *   This includes:
        *   Resolving ambiguous references (e.g., "add *it* to my shopping list").
        *   Inferring context for incomplete requests (e.g., "remind me about that later" referring to the last mentioned item).
        *   Personalizing interpretations based on user habits or location.
- [ ] **Develop Comprehensive NLU Test Suite** [AI/NLP Engineer]
  - Create an extensive suite of unit and integration tests for the NLU components.
    *   Cover a wide variety of natural language inputs, including:
        *   Synonyms and alternative phrasings.
        *   Complex sentence structures.
        *   Inputs with implied context.
        *   Edge cases for dates, times, and recurrence.
    *   Automate testing to ensure consistent accuracy and prevent regressions during model updates.
