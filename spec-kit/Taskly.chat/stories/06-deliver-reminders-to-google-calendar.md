## Story: Deliver Reminders to Google Calendar

**Description:**
As a user with Google Calendar integration enabled, I want Taskly.chat to automatically add my scheduled reminders and recurring tasks as events in my specified Google Calendar, so I can view my Taskly.chat tasks alongside my other personal and professional commitments within my calendar interface. Each calendar event should clearly indicate it originated from Taskly.chat and include the task description. If the reminder is for a specific date and time, it should be added as a timed event. If it is an all-day reminder (e.g., 'Remind me to submit report on Friday'), it should be added as an all-day event.

### Tasks

- [ ] **Implement Google Calendar OAuth Flow** [Backend Engineer]
  - Develop the backend endpoints and logic required for users to authenticate with Google, grant Taskly.chat access to their Google Calendars, and securely store the resulting OAuth tokens.
    
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   User can initiate the Google OAuth flow from Taskly.chat.
        *   Upon successful authorization, Taskly.chat securely stores valid access and refresh tokens linked to the user.
        *   A token refresh mechanism is implemented to ensure continuous access without re-authentication.
- [ ] **Develop Google Calendar API Service Layer** [Backend Engineer]
  - Create a dedicated service or module within the Node.js backend to abstract interactions with the Google Calendar API. This service will handle listing user calendars, creating events, updating events, and deleting events.
    
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The service can successfully list all available Google Calendars for an authenticated user.
        *   The service can create a new event in a specified Google Calendar.
        *   The service can update an existing event in Google Calendar (e.g., when a task changes).
        *   The service can delete an event from Google Calendar.
        *   Robust error handling for Google Calendar API responses (e.g., network issues, authorization errors, rate limits) is implemented.
- [ ] **Extend Task & User Models for Calendar Integration** [Backend Engineer]
  - Modify the PostgreSQL database schema to include necessary fields for storing Google Calendar integration preferences and linking Taskly.chat tasks to their corresponding Google Calendar events.
    
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The User model includes fields such as `googleCalendarIntegrationEnabled` (boolean) and `selectedGoogleCalendarId` (string) to store user preferences.
        *   The Task model includes a nullable field `googleCalendarEventId` (string) to store the ID of the corresponding Google Calendar event, facilitating updates and deletions.
- [ ] **Implement Task-to-Google Event Conversion Logic** [Backend Engineer]
  - Develop the core logic to accurately map Taskly.chat task properties (title, description, due date, due time, recurrence, all-day status) to Google Calendar event properties (summary, description, start, end, all-day flag).
    
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Taskly.chat tasks with a specific date and time are correctly converted into timed Google Calendar events.
        *   Taskly.chat tasks marked as 'all-day' are correctly converted into all-day Google Calendar events.
        *   The Google Calendar event `summary` is automatically generated with a clear indicator of origin (e.g., `"[Taskly.chat] " + task.title`).
        *   The Google Calendar event `description` includes the full `task.description` from Taskly.chat.
- [ ] **Develop Event Synchronization Mechanism (Creation/Updates)** [Backend Engineer]
  - Implement a robust mechanism within the Task Management service (Node.js) to automatically synchronize Taskly.chat tasks with Google Calendar. This includes triggering the creation of new events and updating existing ones when tasks are modified in Taskly.chat.
    
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   New scheduled or recurring tasks created in Taskly.chat successfully trigger the creation of a corresponding event in the user's selected Google Calendar.
        *   Changes to a task's title, description, due date/time, or all-day status in Taskly.chat are accurately reflected in the corresponding Google Calendar event.
        *   Synchronization operations are handled asynchronously (e.g., via AWS SQS) to prevent blocking user actions and ensure reliability.
- [ ] **Implement Task Deletion Synchronization** [Backend Engineer]
  - Ensure that when a task is deleted from Taskly.chat, its corresponding event in Google Calendar is also automatically removed.
    
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Deleting a task in Taskly.chat that has an associated Google Calendar event successfully triggers the deletion of that event from Google Calendar.
- [ ] **Build Google Calendar Integration Settings UI** [Frontend Engineer]
  - Develop the user interface within Taskly.chat's dedicated structured UIs (React with Next.js) that allows users to manage their Google Calendar integration settings.
    
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The UI provides a clear toggle or button to enable/disable Google Calendar integration.
        *   A button or link is available to initiate the Google OAuth flow, redirecting the user as needed.
        *   A dropdown or list displays the user's available Google Calendars (fetched from the backend) for them to select which calendar Taskly.chat should use.
        *   The user's current integration status and selected calendar are clearly displayed.
        *   The UI is responsive and provides a seamless user experience.
- [ ] **Design Google Calendar Integration Settings** [UX/UI Designer]
  - Create wireframes and high-fidelity mockups for the Google Calendar integration settings page or section within Taskly.chat's structured user interface.
    
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Designs clearly illustrate the user flow for enabling and disabling the Google Calendar integration.
        *   Designs include the visual elements and interaction patterns for initiating the OAuth authentication process.
        *   Designs present an intuitive method for users to select a specific Google Calendar from a list.
        *   The design ensures visual consistency with the overall Taskly.chat UI/UX guidelines.
