## Story: Configure Google Calendar Integration

**Description:**
As a user, I want to easily connect my Google account with Taskly.chat through a secure OAuth 2.0 flow, so Taskly.chat can seamlessly integrate with my Google Calendar for reminder delivery and scheduling tasks. This includes allowing me to select which specific Google Calendar Taskly.chat should use. The integration setup should be accessible via the structured UI settings. I should also be able to disconnect or reconfigure the integration at any time.

### Tasks

- [ ] **Design and Implement Database Schema for Google Calendar Integration** [Backend Engineer]
  - Define necessary tables and fields in PostgreSQL to securely store Google integration details. This includes:
    *   User ID
    *   Google account identifier
    *   Encrypted access token
    *   Encrypted refresh token
    *   Token expiry timestamp
    *   Selected Google Calendar ID for events/reminders
- [ ] **Develop Google OAuth 2.0 Endpoints (Initiation & Callback)** [Backend Engineer]
  - Implement the core backend logic for Google OAuth 2.0:
    *   Create an endpoint (e.g., `/api/integrations/google/connect`) to initiate the OAuth flow, generating the authorization URL with required scopes.
    *   Create a callback endpoint (e.g., `/api/integrations/google/callback`) to handle the redirect from Google.
    *   Exchange the authorization code for access and refresh tokens upon successful callback.
    *   Securely store the tokens and user's Google ID in the database.
    *   Handle potential errors and edge cases during the OAuth process.
- [ ] **Implement Secure Token Storage and Refresh Mechanism** [Backend Engineer]
  - Ensure the robust and secure management of Google API tokens:
    *   Implement encryption for access and refresh tokens before storage in the database.
    *   Develop a mechanism to automatically refresh expired access tokens using the stored refresh token before making Google Calendar API calls.
    *   Implement logging and alerts for refresh token expiry or failure.
- [ ] **Develop Google Calendar Listing API** [Backend Engineer]
  - Create a backend API endpoint (e.g., `/api/integrations/google/calendars`) that:
    *   Authenticates the user.
    *   Uses the stored Google tokens to fetch a list of all available Google Calendars associated with the user's connected account.
    *   Returns the list of calendars (ID and name) to the frontend.
- [ ] **Develop API for Selecting/Updating Google Calendar** [Backend Engineer]
  - Create a backend API endpoint (e.g., `/api/integrations/google/select-calendar`) to:
    *   Receive a selected Google Calendar ID from the frontend.
    *   Persist this selected calendar ID in the database for the user, linking it to their Google integration.
    *   Validate that the selected calendar ID belongs to the connected Google account.
- [ ] **Develop API for Disconnecting Google Calendar Integration** [Backend Engineer]
  - Create a backend API endpoint (e.g., `/api/integrations/google/disconnect`) to:
    *   Revoke Google API tokens from Google's end, if necessary.
    *   Clear all stored integration-related data (tokens, selected calendar ID) for the user in the database.
    *   Update the user's integration status.
- [ ] **Build Google Calendar Integration Settings UI** [Frontend Engineer]
  - Develop the user interface within the structured UI for managing Google Calendar integration:
    *   Create a dedicated section in 'Settings' for Integrations.
    *   Display the current status of Google Calendar integration (e.g., 'Not Connected', 'Connected to [email]', 'Error').
    *   Include a prominent 'Connect Google Account' button to initiate the OAuth flow.
- [ ] **Implement OAuth Flow Initiation from UI** [Frontend Engineer]
  - Integrate the 'Connect Google Account' button to:
    *   Call the backend's `/api/integrations/google/connect` endpoint.
    *   Redirect the user to the received Google authorization URL.
    *   Handle the redirect back to the Taskly.chat frontend after successful Google authentication, potentially displaying a loading or success message.
- [ ] **Develop UI for Google Calendar Selection** [Frontend Engineer]
  - Once a user is connected, build the UI to manage their calendar selection:
    *   Display a loading indicator while fetching the list of available calendars from `/api/integrations/google/calendars`.
    *   Present a dropdown or list of fetched Google Calendars, allowing the user to select their preferred calendar for Taskly.chat use.
    *   Include a 'Save' button to send the selected calendar ID to the backend via `/api/integrations/google/select-calendar`.
    *   Provide clear visual feedback on successful selection or any errors.
- [ ] **Implement Disconnect/Reconfigure UI** [Frontend Engineer]
  - Provide options for users to manage their integration:
    *   Add a 'Disconnect' button or link within the Google Calendar integration settings.
    *   Implement a confirmation dialog before proceeding with disconnection.
    *   Call the backend's `/api/integrations/google/disconnect` endpoint when 'Disconnect' is confirmed.
    *   Ensure the UI reverts to the 'Connect' state after disconnection.
    *   Allow easy re-initiation of the connection process for reconfiguration.
- [ ] **Design Google Calendar Integration UI/UX Flow** [UX/UI Designer]
  - Create a comprehensive design for the Google Calendar integration experience:
    *   Develop wireframes and high-fidelity mockups for the integration settings page within the structured UI.
    *   Design the user journey for connecting, selecting a specific calendar, and disconnecting the integration.
    *   Define all UI states: initial, loading, connected, disconnected, error, and success messages.
    *   Ensure the design is intuitive, secure, and consistent with Taskly.chat's overall aesthetic.
- [ ] **Define Google Calendar Integration OAuth Scopes and Success Criteria** [Product Manager]
  - Specify the product requirements for the Google Calendar integration:
    *   Clearly define the minimal necessary Google API OAuth scopes (e.g., `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly`) to ensure least privilege.
    *   Outline detailed acceptance criteria for a successful integration, covering connection, calendar selection, task scheduling, reminder delivery, and disconnection.
    *   Develop a plan for user acceptance testing (UAT) scenarios.
