## Story: As a user, I want to securely log in and manage my profile

**Description:**
As a user, I want to be able to create an account, log in securely, and manage my basic profile information so that my data is personalized and protected.

### Tasks

- [ ] **Implement User Registration API** [Backend Engineer]
  - Develop a robust API endpoint for new user registration.
    *   Accepts username/email, password, and basic profile information.
    *   Hashes passwords securely using a strong algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
    *   Performs input validation (e.g., strong password requirements, unique email).
    *   Stores user data in the PostgreSQL database.
    *   Returns appropriate success/error responses.
- [ ] **Implement User Login and Session Management API** [Backend Engineer]
  - Develop an API endpoint for user authentication and session creation.
    *   Accepts username/email and password.
    *   Verifies credentials against stored hashed passwords.
    *   Generates a secure access token (e.g., JWT) upon successful login.
    *   Optionally generates a refresh token.
    *   Returns tokens to the client.
    *   Implements rate limiting for login attempts.
- [ ] **Implement User Profile Management API** [Backend Engineer]
  - Develop API endpoints for viewing and updating user profile information.
    *   `GET /api/profile`: Retrieves the currently logged-in user's profile data.
    *   `PUT /api/profile`: Allows the logged-in user to update their profile (e.g., name, email, notification preferences).
    *   Requires authentication for all profile operations.
    *   Performs input validation for updates.
- [ ] **Design and Implement User Database Schema** [Backend Engineer]
  - Design and implement the PostgreSQL schema for storing user-related data.
    *   `users` table:
        *   `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
        *   `email` (VARCHAR, UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
        *   `password_hash` (VARCHAR, NOT NULL)
        *   `first_name` (VARCHAR)
        *   `last_name` (VARCHAR)
        *   `created_at` (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT NOW())
        *   `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT NOW())
    *   Define necessary indexes for performance.
    *   Set up migration scripts.
- [ ] **Develop User Registration UI and Integration** [Frontend/Conversational UI Developer]
  - Create the user interface for account creation.
    *   Design intuitive form fields for email, password, and password confirmation.
    *   Implement client-side input validation.
    *   Integrate with the backend registration API.
    *   Handle success and error messages from the API.
    *   Redirect user to login/dashboard upon successful registration.
- [ ] **Develop User Login UI and Integration** [Frontend/Conversational UI Developer]
  - Create the user interface for secure user login.
    *   Design intuitive form fields for email and password.
    *   Integrate with the backend login API.
    *   Store authentication tokens securely (e.g., in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` for MVP, or more securely for production).
    *   Handle success and error messages from the API.
    *   Redirect user to the main application dashboard upon successful login.
- [ ] **Develop User Profile Management UI and Integration** [Frontend/Conversational UI Developer]
  - Create the user interface for viewing and updating profile information.
    *   Display current user information (e.g., name, email).
    *   Provide editable fields for updating profile details.
    *   Integrate with the backend profile management API (`GET` and `PUT` endpoints).
    *   Implement loading states and success/error notifications for updates.
    *   Include a "Logout" functionality that clears the session tokens.
- [ ] **Comprehensive Testing for User Auth and Profile Management** [QA Engineer]
  - Develop and execute test cases for all authentication and profile management features.
    *   **Registration Testing:**
        *   Successful registration with valid data.
        *   Registration with existing email.
        *   Registration with invalid password (too short, no special chars, etc.).
        *   Registration with invalid email format.
    *   **Login Testing:**
        *   Successful login with correct credentials.
        *   Login with incorrect password.
        *   Login with non-existent email.
        *   Login with locked/disabled account (if implemented).
        *   Verify token persistence across sessions.
        *   Test logout functionality.
    *   **Profile Management Testing:**
        *   Verify correct profile data display.
        *   Successful update of profile information.
        *   Attempt to update profile without authentication.
        *   Attempt to update with invalid data (e.g., malformed email).
    *   **Security Testing:**
        *   Test for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS (if applicable).
        *   Verify proper password hashing (indirectly by testing login success).
        *   Test API endpoint security (e.g., unauthorized access attempts).
