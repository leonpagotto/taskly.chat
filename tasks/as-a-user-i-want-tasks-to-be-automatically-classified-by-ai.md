## Story: As a user, I want tasks to be automatically classified by AI

**Description:**
As a user, when I create a task, I want the AI to automatically classify and categorize it (e.g., 'work', 'personal', 'shopping', 'health') so that my tasks are organized without manual effort.

### Tasks

- [ ] **Implement API endpoint for task creation with AI classification trigger** [Backend Engineer]
  - Create a new API endpoint (e.g., POST /tasks) or modify an existing one to handle new task submissions. This endpoint must accept a task description and other relevant task attributes. After receiving the task, it should make an internal or external call to the AI classification service. It should wait for the classification result before saving the task to the database. Acceptance Criteria: * New POST /tasks endpoint created. * Endpoint successfully receives task data. * An internal call to the AI classification module is initiated. * The task is not saved until a classification result is obtained.
- [ ] **Develop or integrate AI service for task category classification** [Lead AI/ML Engineer]
  - Design and implement a microservice or module responsible for classifying task descriptions. This can involve: * Integrating with OpenAI API for text classification. * Developing a custom model using a pre-trained transformer or other NLP techniques. The service should expose an API (e.g., gRPC, HTTP) that accepts a task description and returns a predicted category (e.g., "work", "personal", "shopping"). Define the initial set of categories based on product requirements. Acceptance Criteria: * AI classification service/module is implemented. * It can take a text input (task description). * It returns a relevant task category from a predefined list. * Integration with OpenAI API (or chosen LLM) is functional.
- [ ] **Integrate AI classification service into the core task creation logic** [Backend Engineer]
  - Modify the backend task service to invoke the AI classification service developed in the previous task. Handle the response from the AI service, including potential errors or fallback scenarios. Persist the returned category in the task's database record. Acceptance Criteria: * Backend task service successfully calls the AI classification service. * The returned category is parsed and validated. * The classified category is stored in the database for the respective task. * Error handling for AI service failures is implemented.
- [ ] **Update database schema to store AI-classified task categories** [Backend Engineer]
  - Add a new column (e.g., category_id or category_name) to the `tasks` table in PostgreSQL. This column will store the AI-determined classification for each task. Consider creating a separate `categories` table if categories need to be dynamic or have additional metadata. Ensure appropriate indexing for performance if categories will be frequently queried. Acceptance Criteria: * `tasks` table schema updated with a new column for task category. * Database migrations are prepared and tested. * The new column can store string values representing categories.
- [ ] **Update task creation UI to trigger and display AI classification** [Frontend/Conversational UI Developer]
  - When a user creates a new task, the frontend should send the task description to the backend task creation API. After the task is created and classified by the AI, the frontend should retrieve and display the classified category to the user. Consider showing the category as a pre-selected option in a dropdown or as a label next to the task. Allow users to override the AI-suggested category manually if needed. Acceptance Criteria: * Task creation form sends data to the new backend endpoint. * The UI displays the AI-suggested category upon task creation. * Users can optionally override the AI-suggested category.
- [ ] **Implement display of AI-classified categories on task lists** [Frontend/Conversational UI Developer]
  - Modify existing task list components (e.g., "My Tasks", "All Tasks") to show the AI-assigned category for each task. This could involve: * Adding a category label next to each task. * Allowing users to filter or group tasks by category. Ensure consistency across web and mobile interfaces. Acceptance Criteria: * Task lists prominently display the classified category for each task. * Filtering by category is available (stretch goal for MVP if not crucial).
- [ ] **Create and execute end-to-end tests for AI task classification feature** [QA Engineer]
  - Develop a comprehensive test plan covering the entire user journey: task input, AI classification, backend storage, and frontend display. Write automated E2E tests using frameworks like Playwright or Cypress for web, and Appium/Detox for mobile (if applicable). Test various task descriptions to ensure accurate classification across different categories (positive and negative cases). Verify error handling when AI service is unavailable or returns an invalid response. Acceptance Criteria: * Test cases covering task creation with AI classification are defined. * Automated E2E tests are implemented and pass for happy paths. * Tests cover edge cases and error scenarios for AI classification. * Performance of classification is within acceptable limits.
