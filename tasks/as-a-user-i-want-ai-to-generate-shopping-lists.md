## Story: As a user, I want AI to generate shopping lists

**Description:**
As a user, I want to be able to tell Taskly.chat my shopping needs in natural language, and have the AI generate a structured shopping list, optionally with item suggestions, so I don't forget anything.

### Tasks

- [ ] **Implement UI for natural language shopping list input** [Frontend/Conversational UI Developer]
  - Develop conversational UI components enabling users to input shopping needs via text. Integrate with Web Speech API for voice input for shopping list requests and ensure inputs are sent to the backend API.
    
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   User can type their shopping needs into the chat interface.
        *   User can use voice input to articulate their shopping requirements.
        *   The natural language input is successfully transmitted to a backend endpoint for processing.
- [ ] **Develop backend API for shopping list generation requests** [Backend Engineer]
  - Design and implement a new REST or WebSocket endpoint to receive natural language input from the frontend for shopping list generation. The endpoint must validate incoming requests and forward the natural language input to the AI service for processing.
    
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A `POST /api/shopping-lists/generate` endpoint is created and accessible.
        *   The endpoint correctly accepts a `text` field in the request body containing the user's natural language input.
        *   The endpoint successfully invokes the AI service with the received text for shopping list processing.
- [ ] **Implement AI logic for natural language shopping list generation** [Lead AI/ML Engineer]
  - Develop the AI service logic to process natural language input for creating shopping lists. This involves integrating with an external LLM (e.g., OpenAI API) to generate a structured shopping list, potentially with item suggestions. Implement robust prompt engineering strategies to ensure accuracy and relevance of generated items.
    
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The AI service can parse and understand user's shopping needs from natural language input.
        *   The AI service successfully integrates with an external LLM to generate a structured shopping list (e.g., a JSON array of items and quantities).
        *   Optional item suggestions are generated and included in the output when appropriate.
        *   The generated lists are consistently relevant and accurate based on diverse inputs.
- [ ] **Implement database schema and persistence for shopping lists** [Backend Engineer]
  - Design and create the PostgreSQL database schema for storing AI-generated shopping lists, including details like list name, user association, and a structured representation of items (e.g., JSONB for items and quantities). Implement backend logic to persist generated lists and provide API endpoints for retrieving, updating, and deleting existing shopping lists.
    
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A `shopping_lists` table is created in PostgreSQL with fields such as `id`, `user_id`, `name`, and `items` (JSONB/array of objects).
        *   AI-generated shopping lists are successfully saved to the database upon completion of the generation process.
        *   API endpoints for retrieving a user's shopping lists, updating an existing list, and deleting a list are implemented and functional.
- [ ] **Develop UI to display and interact with generated shopping lists** [Frontend/Conversational UI Developer]
  - Implement user interface components to clearly display the structured shopping list received from the backend/AI. Provide functionality for users to interact with the list, including editing individual item details (e.g., quantity, name), adding new items, and removing existing ones. Ensure that any modifications made in the UI can be saved back to the backend.
    
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The AI-generated shopping list is displayed in a clear, readable, and structured format on the UI.
        *   Users can easily edit the name or quantity of individual items within the displayed list.
        *   Users can add new items to the list or remove existing items through the UI.
        *   Changes made by the user are successfully transmitted to the backend for persistence and update.
- [ ] **Create and execute test plan for shopping list generation and management** [QA Engineer]
  - Develop a comprehensive test plan covering the end-to-end functionality of the shopping list feature, from natural language input to AI generation, storage, and UI interaction. Execute tests for a wide range of natural language inputs (simple, complex, ambiguous, empty). Verify data persistence, UI responsiveness, and handle edge cases, including invalid inputs or unexpected AI responses.
    
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A detailed test plan is created, covering all stages: input, AI processing, backend storage, and UI display/interaction.
        *   Test cases verify the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated lists across various natural language inputs.
        *   Tests confirm proper functionality of UI interactions (adding, editing, removing items) and data persistence.
        *   Edge cases (e.g., empty input, very long requests, unusual item names) are covered, and the system behaves gracefully.
        *   All identified bugs are accurately logged with clear reproduction steps and expected outcomes.
