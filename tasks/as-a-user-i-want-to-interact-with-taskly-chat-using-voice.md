## Story: As a user, I want to interact with Taskly.chat using voice

**Description:**
As a user, I want to be able to use voice input for creating tasks, adding shopping items, and interacting with the AI so that I can manage my responsibilities hands-free.

### Tasks

- [ ] **Develop Voice Input UI Component** [Frontend/Conversational UI Developer]
  - Create a distinct UI component (e.g., a microphone icon button) that users can tap/click to initiate voice input.
    *   A clearly visible microphone icon is present in the chat interface.
    *   Clicking the icon toggles the voice input mode.
    *   Visual feedback (e.g., animation, color change) indicates active listening.
- [ ] **Implement Browser-based Speech-to-Text via Web Speech API** [Frontend/Conversational UI Developer]
  - Integrate the browser's native Web Speech API to capture audio input from the user's microphone and convert it into text.
    *   Upon activating voice input, the browser's microphone permission prompt appears (if not already granted).
    *   Speech spoken by the user is accurately transcribed into text.
    *   Transcription happens in real-time or near real-time.
    *   Error handling for microphone access denial or STT failure.
- [ ] **Display Live Voice Transcription in UI** [Frontend/Conversational UI Developer]
  - Show the live, transcribed text as the user speaks, providing immediate feedback on what the system is hearing.
    *   Transcribed text appears in a designated area (e.g., above the input field) while voice input is active.
    *   Text updates dynamically as more speech is recognized.
    *   Final transcribed text populates the main input field or is sent to AI upon voice input completion.
- [ ] **Develop Logic to Send Transcribed Text to AI Backend** [Frontend/Conversational UI Developer]
  - Implement the functionality to send the final transcribed text to the backend for AI processing via WebSocket or a dedicated API endpoint.
    *   Successfully transmits the transcribed text to the appropriate backend endpoint.
    *   Handles network errors during transmission.
    *   Integration with WebSocket for real-time interaction.
- [ ] **Implement Backend API Endpoint for Transcribed Text** [Backend Engineer]
  - Develop a backend API endpoint (e.g., /api/voice-input) that receives transcribed text from the frontend. This endpoint will then forward the text to the AI service.
    *   An endpoint exists that accepts POST requests with a text payload.
    *   Validates the incoming text data.
    *   Successfully receives text from the frontend.
- [ ] **Integrate Backend with Lead AI/ML Engineer's LLM Service** [Backend Engineer]
  - Implement the logic within the backend to take the received transcribed text and send it to the AI/ML service (OpenAI API or internal LLM) for natural language understanding and action generation.
    *   Successfully sends the transcribed text to the AI service.
    *   Receives and parses the AI's response.
    *   Handles potential errors or timeouts from the AI service.
- [ ] **Develop/Refine AI Model for Voice Command Interpretation** [Lead AI/ML Engineer]
  - Ensure the AI model (LLM with custom fine-tuning or prompt engineering) is robust enough to accurately interpret transcribed voice commands for creating tasks, adding shopping items, and general conversation.
    *   AI accurately identifies intent (create task, add item, general query) from transcribed text.
    *   AI extracts relevant entities (task name, item name, quantity, deadline) from the input.
    *   AI generates appropriate responses or confirms actions.
- [ ] **Create Comprehensive Test Plan for Voice Input Feature** [QA Engineer]
  - Develop a detailed test plan covering all aspects of the voice input feature, including functional, performance, security, and usability testing.
    *   Test cases cover microphone permission handling.
    *   Test cases cover speech-to-text accuracy in various environments.
    *   Test cases cover AI command interpretation for tasks and shopping items.
    *   Test cases cover UI responsiveness and feedback.
    *   Test cases include error handling scenarios.
- [ ] **Execute Voice Input Feature Test Cases** [QA Engineer]
  - Perform all test cases defined in the test plan for the voice input feature across different browsers, devices, and user scenarios.
    *   All test cases from the plan are executed.
    *   Bugs and defects are accurately reported and tracked.
    *   Performance of voice recognition and AI processing is within acceptable limits.
    *   Feature meets defined quality standards.
