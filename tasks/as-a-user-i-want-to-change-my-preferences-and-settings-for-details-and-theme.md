## Story: As a user, I want to change my preferences and settings, for details and theme

**Description:**


### Tasks

- [ ] **Implement User Preferences Database Schema and API** [Backend Engineer]
  - Design and implement the database schema to store user preferences and develop the necessary API endpoints.
    
    *   **Database Schema:** Extend the `User` table or create a `UserPreferences` table to store settings such as `theme` (e.g., 'light', 'dark'), `display_details_level` (e.g., 'compact', 'standard', 'verbose'), and `notification_settings` (e.g., boolean toggles).
    *   **API Endpoints:**
        *   `GET /api/v1/user/preferences`: Retrieve the current user's preferences.
        *   `PUT /api/v1/user/preferences`: Update the current user's preferences. This endpoint should accept an object with preference keys and their new values.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** Ensure only authenticated users can access and modify their own preferences.
    *   **Validation:** Implement server-side validation for all incoming preference values to ensure data integrity and security.
- [ ] **Develop User Preferences and Settings UI** [Frontend/Conversational UI Developer]
  - Create a dedicated section in the application's user interface for managing preferences and settings.
    
    *   **UI Components:** Design and implement interactive UI elements for:
        *   Theme selection (e.g., a toggle or radio buttons for 'Light Mode' / 'Dark Mode').
        *   Detail display level selection (e.g., a dropdown for 'Compact', 'Standard', 'Verbose' task views).
        *   Any other relevant preference toggles (e.g., notification preferences).
    *   **Data Fetching:** Upon loading the settings page, make an API call to `GET /api/v1/user/preferences` to pre-fill the UI with the user's current settings.
    *   **Data Submission:** Implement logic to send updated preferences to the backend via `PUT /api/v1/user/preferences` when the user saves their changes.
    *   **User Feedback:** Provide visual feedback for saving changes (e.g., a success message, loading indicator) and handle potential API errors gracefully.
- [ ] **Integrate and Apply Selected Theme Across Application** [Frontend/Conversational UI Developer]
  - Implement a robust theming system that dynamically applies the user's selected theme (light/dark) throughout the entire application.
    
    *   **Theming System:** Establish a mechanism (e.g., using CSS variables, a theming context in React, or a state management solution) to manage and apply different themes.
    *   **Dynamic Styling:** Ensure all relevant UI components, including chat bubbles, task cards, navigation bars, and backgrounds, correctly switch their styles based on the active theme.
    *   **Persistence:** Store the user's chosen theme locally (e.g., in `localStorage`) for immediate application on subsequent visits, providing a seamless user experience before the backend preferences are fully loaded.
    *   **Real-time Update:** Ensure that changing the theme in the settings UI immediately reflects across the application without requiring a page refresh.
- [ ] **Develop Comprehensive Test Plan for User Preferences and Settings** [QA Engineer]
  - Design and execute a thorough test plan to ensure the reliability, functionality, and responsiveness of the user preferences and settings features.
    
    *   **Functional Tests:**
        *   Verify successful navigation to and from the settings page.
        *   Confirm accurate loading of initial preferences from the backend.
        *   Test changing each preference option (e.g., light to dark theme, detail level) and verify the UI updates correctly.
        *   Verify that saved preferences persist across application sessions and reloads.
        *   Ensure all preference changes are correctly saved to the backend.
    *   **Negative Tests:**
        *   Test behavior with invalid or unexpected input (if applicable).
        *   Verify appropriate error messages are displayed for failed API requests.
    *   **UI/UX Tests:**
        *   Assess the responsiveness and visual consistency of the settings UI across different screen sizes and devices.
        *   Verify the immediate application of theme changes without visual glitches.
    *   **Security Tests:**
        *   Confirm that only authenticated users can access and modify their own preferences.
        *   Verify proper authorization controls prevent unauthorized access or modification of other users' settings.
    *   **Integration Tests:**
        *   Verify seamless interaction between the frontend settings UI and the backend preferences API.
