## Story: As a user, I want to track and manage my habits simply

**Description:**
As a user, I want to be able to define and track simple habits within Taskly.chat, so I can build consistent routines and see my progress over time.

### Tasks

- [ ] **Design and Implement Habit Database Schema** [Backend Engineer]
  - Design and implement the necessary database tables and relationships to store habit information. This includes:
    *   `habits` table: `id`, `user_id`, `name`, `description`, `frequency` (e.g., daily, weekly, specific days), `start_date`, `is_active`.
    *   `habit_completions` table: `id`, `habit_id`, `completion_date`.
    
    Ensure proper indexing for efficient queries and define foreign key constraints.
- [ ] **Develop API for Habit Creation** [Backend Engineer]
  - Develop a RESTful API endpoint to allow authenticated users to create new habits.
    *   **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/habits`
    *   **Request Body:** `name` (string), `description` (string, optional), `frequency` (string, e.g., 'daily', 'weekly', 'MWF'), `start_date` (date string).
    *   **Response:** The newly created habit object including its unique `id`.
    *   Implement robust input validation and error handling.
- [ ] **Develop API for Habit Retrieval** [Backend Engineer]
  - Implement API endpoints to fetch a user's habits and individual habit details.
    *   **Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/habits` (retrieves a list of all active habits for the authenticated user).
    *   **Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/habits/{id}` (retrieves a single habit by its ID, belonging to the authenticated user).
    *   Ensure proper authorization to prevent users from accessing others' habit data.
- [ ] **Develop API for Marking Habit as Complete** [Backend Engineer]
  - Create an API endpoint to record a habit's completion for a given date.
    *   **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/habits/{id}/complete`
    *   **Request Body:** `completion_date` (date string, optional, defaults to today's date if not provided).
    *   **Response:** Success status or updated habit completion streak information.
    *   Handle idempotency, ensuring that marking a habit complete multiple times on the same day does not create duplicate records.
- [ ] **Implement Habit Definition UI** [Frontend/Conversational UI Developer]
  - Develop a user interface for creating new habits within the Taskly.chat application.
    *   Provide input fields for habit name, an optional description, frequency (e.g., daily, weekly with day selection), and a start date.
    *   Integrate this UI with the backend `POST /api/v1/habits` endpoint.
    *   Include client-side validation and clear error feedback for the user.
- [ ] **Implement Habit Listing and Tracking UI** [Frontend/Conversational UI Developer]
  - Develop UI components to display a user's active habits and allow them to be marked as complete.
    *   Display a clear list of habits with their names and current status (e.g., 'completed today', 'pending', 'skipped').
    *   Provide an interactive element (e.g., checkbox, button) next to each habit to mark it as complete, triggering the `POST /api/v1/habits/{id}/complete` API call.
    *   Visually indicate the completion status for the current day and potentially basic progress (e.g., 'X days completed this week').
- [ ] **Integrate NLP for Habit Intent Recognition** [Lead AI/ML Engineer]
  - Design, train, and integrate an NLU model to accurately recognize user intents related to habit management from natural language input.
    *   Identify intents such as 'create_habit', 'complete_habit', 'list_habits', 'update_habit', 'delete_habit'.
    *   Extract relevant entities like habit name, desired frequency, and specific dates from user utterances (e.g., 'meditate daily', 'read a book on Wednesdays', 'mark run as done today').
- [ ] **Develop Conversational Responses for Habit Interactions** [Lead AI/ML Engineer]
  - Develop and integrate the conversational AI logic to generate appropriate and helpful responses for all habit-related commands.
    *   Provide clear confirmations for habit creation and completion (e.g., 'Got it! I've added 'exercise' to your daily habits.').
    *   Offer user-friendly presentations of habit lists.
    *   Handle clarifying questions and edge cases gracefully (e.g., if a habit name is ambiguous, asking for clarification).
- [ ] **Integrate Conversational Input for Habit Management in UI** [Frontend/Conversational UI Developer]
  - Connect the frontend conversational UI with the AI services and backend APIs for full habit management capabilities through natural language.
    *   Implement logic to send user's natural language input to the AI/ML backend for processing.
    *   Receive and display AI-generated responses back to the user.
    *   Based on AI intent recognition, trigger the appropriate backend API calls (e.g., calling `POST /api/v1/habits` when a 'create_habit' intent is detected with extracted entities).
- [ ] **End-to-End Testing for Habit Tracking Feature** [QA Engineer]
  - Develop and execute a comprehensive test plan for the entire habit tracking feature, covering all aspects:
    *   **Functional Testing:** Habit creation, retrieval, update, deletion (if implemented), and completion marking via both UI and conversational input.
    *   **Data Integrity Testing:** Verify data persistence, correct completion tracking, and accurate display of habit status.
    *   **Edge Case Testing:** Test scenarios like marking a habit complete multiple times, invalid habit names or frequencies, and habit management with no habits defined.
    *   **User Experience:** Ensure UI responsiveness, clarity of information, and natural flow of conversational interactions.
    *   **Performance & Security:** Basic checks for response times and authorization enforcement.
