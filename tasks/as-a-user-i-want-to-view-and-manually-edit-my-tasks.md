## Story: As a user, I want to view and manually edit my tasks

**Description:**
As a user, I want to be able to view a list of my structured tasks and manually edit their details (e.g., title, description, due date, category, status) if needed, to ensure accuracy and reflect changes.

### Tasks

- [ ] **Develop API endpoint for fetching user tasks** [Backend Engineer]
  - Create a secure RESTful API endpoint that allows authenticated users to retrieve a list of their structured tasks. This endpoint should:
    *   Return tasks associated with the authenticated user.
    *   Support pagination and basic filtering (e.g., by status).
    *   Return essential task details: id, title, description, due date, category, status.
- [ ] **Implement database query for retrieving user tasks** [Backend Engineer]
  - Write database queries (SQL) to efficiently fetch task data from PostgreSQL. This includes:
    *   Joining necessary tables if task data is normalized.
    *   Handling potential performance bottlenecks for users with many tasks.
- [ ] **Develop API endpoint for updating a specific task** [Backend Engineer]
  - Create a secure RESTful API endpoint (e.g., PATCH /tasks/{id}) to allow users to update the details of an existing task. This endpoint must:
    *   Accept fields like title, description, due date, category, and status.
    *   Perform server-side validation on all incoming data.
    *   Ensure the user has permission to modify the specified task.
- [ ] **Implement database update logic for tasks** [Backend Engineer]
  - Write database queries (SQL) to update specific fields of a task in PostgreSQL based on the incoming API request. This includes:
    *   Handling partial updates (only changing specified fields).
    *   Ensuring data integrity and transactional consistency.
- [ ] **Build task list display UI** [Frontend/Conversational UI Developer]
  - Develop the React/Next.js UI component to display a list of tasks fetched from the backend. This component should:
    *   Render each task with its title and a brief overview.
    *   Provide an intuitive way to navigate to a task's detailed view/edit form.
    *   Implement loading states and error handling for API calls.
- [ ] **Create task detail view and edit form UI** [Frontend/Conversational UI Developer]
  - Develop the React/Next.js UI for viewing and editing a single task. This includes:
    *   Displaying all editable fields: title, description, due date, category, status.
    *   Providing input fields (text, date pickers, dropdowns) for each detail.
    *   Implementing a 'Save Changes' button and a 'Cancel' button.
    *   Handling local UI state for form inputs.
- [ ] **Implement client-side task update logic** [Frontend/Conversational UI Developer]
  - Develop the client-side logic to handle task updates:
    *   Capture user input from the edit form.
    *   Send a PATCH request to the backend API with the updated task data.
    *   Handle API responses, including success messages or validation errors.
    *   Update the local task state after a successful save.
- [ ] **Develop test plan for task viewing and editing** [QA Engineer]
  - Create a comprehensive test plan covering all aspects of task viewing and editing functionality. This plan should include:
    *   Functional test cases for listing, viewing, and editing tasks.
    *   Test cases for various data types and edge cases (e.g., long descriptions, invalid dates).
    *   Security test cases for authorization and data access.
    *   Performance considerations for fetching large task lists.
- [ ] **Execute functional and API tests for task management** [QA Engineer]
  - Perform thorough functional and API testing based on the approved test plan. This includes:
    *   Verifying accurate display of tasks.
    *   Testing all editable fields and their constraints.
    *   Ensuring successful saving of changes and proper error handling.
    *   Validating backend API responses and data persistence in the database.
- [ ] **Define task field properties and validation rules** [Product Manager]
  - Collaborate with engineering to define the exact properties for each task field (e.g., title, description, due date, category, status) including:
    *   Data types and format requirements.
    *   Minimum/maximum lengths.
    *   Allowed values for dropdowns (e.g., task status: 'To Do', 'In Progress', 'Done').
    *   Default values and nullability constraints.
