## Summary
Introduce a reusable hook that observes outbound user messages and produces task draft artifacts (and future memory signals) decoupled from ChatShell UI logic.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Hook `useTaskDraftExtraction` created under `apps/chat/src/components/` (or `hooks/`).
- [x] Accepts latest user message content and returns extracted `TaskDraft[]` plus raw parse (future-proof for enrichment).
- [x] Graceful handling of empty or whitespace messages (returns empty drafts array).
- [x] Side-effect free (no direct fetch) â€“ delegates parsing to existing local utilities (placeholder) for now.
- [x] Unit test scaffold or clear TODO markers for future test coverage. (Implemented `useTaskDraftExtraction.spec.tsx`).

## Implementation Notes
Initial version wraps existing `extractTaskDrafts` util and memoizes result.
