## Summary
Design scaffold for memory context injection (future Story 03) without fully implementing retrieval logic—ensuring adapter surfaces can evolve without breaking changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Draft interface for `MemoryContextProvider` defined with placeholder fetch method.
- [ ] System prompt builder reserves insertion marker for memory summaries.
- [ ] Spike note: list of potential memory sources & ranking strategy.
- [ ] Risk notes: performance, staleness, privacy considerations.
- [ ] Recommendation: which later tasks should refine or split this (documented in spike output section).

## Implementation Notes
- Keep implementation minimal—focus on types & insertion contract.
- Avoid premature network calls; use static mock memory sample.

## Progress Log
- 2025-09-19 Task created.
