## Summary
Develop backend pipeline for memory ingestion

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] An API endpoint or internal service that receives user conversation turns
- [ ] Calling the NLP models (from task 2) to extract structured and semantic information
- [ ] Storing structured memories into PostgreSQL (from task 3)
- [ ] Storing semantic memory embeddings into the vector database (from task 4)
- [ ] Handling potential data conflicts or updates for existing memories

Create the backend services and APIs responsible for processing, extracting, and storing user memories after each interaction. This includes:
- An API endpoint or internal service that receives user conversation turns.
- Calling the NLP models (from task 2) to extract structured and semantic information.
- Storing structured memories into PostgreSQL (from task 3).
- Storing semantic memory embeddings into the vector database (from task 4).
- Handling potential data conflicts or updates for existing memories.
