Set up and integrate a vector database (Pinecone/Weaviate) to store embeddings of user conversational turns and extracted semantic memories. This includes:
- Configuring the vector database instance.
- Developing an embedding service that converts raw text into vector representations.
- Implementing the logic to upsert these vectors into the database, associated with the user ID.
