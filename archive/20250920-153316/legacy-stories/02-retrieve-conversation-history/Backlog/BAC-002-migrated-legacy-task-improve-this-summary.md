## Summary
Backend API for Retrieving Conversation History

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] API endpoint is authenticated and authorized, allowing users to only access their own history.
- [ ] Retrieves messages ordered by timestamp (oldest to newest by default, or configurable).
- [ ] Supports pagination parameters (e.g., `limit`, `offset`, or cursor-based) for efficient data loading.
- [ ] Filters messages correctly based on the provided project or thread ID.
- [ ] Returns an empty array if no conversation history exists for the specified context.

## Implementation Notes
- Migrated by normalize-tasks script

Auto-upgraded from legacy placeholder via upgrade-legacy-tasks script.

## Progress Log

title: Backend API for Retrieving Conversation History
responsibleArea: Full-stack Software Engineer
---
Implement a backend API endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/history` or `GET /api/v1/threads/{threadId}/history`) to fetch a paginated list of conversation messages for a given project or thread. The API should return messages in chronological order.

*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   API endpoint is authenticated and authorized, allowing users to only access their own history.
