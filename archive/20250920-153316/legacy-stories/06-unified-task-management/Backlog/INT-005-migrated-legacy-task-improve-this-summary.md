## Summary
Integrate NLP Task Extraction Service into Backend

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Creating an internal service endpoint that receives raw user text input
- [ ] Calling the AI/ML task extraction service and handling its structured output
- [ ] Mapping the extracted data to the `Task` data model
- [ ] Implementing logic to create or update tasks based on the parsed information, possibly requiring user confirmation for ambiguous cases
- [ ] Ensuring robust error handling and fallback mechanisms if NLP parsing fails

## Implementation Notes
- Migrated by normalize-tasks script

Auto-upgraded from legacy placeholder via upgrade-legacy-tasks script.


Acceptance criteria refined automatically from legacy bullet list.

title: Integrate NLP Task Extraction Service into Backend
responsibleArea: Full-stack Software Engineer
---
Integrate the developed NLP model (from TASK-005) into the backend services to enable intelligent task creation and updates from natural language. This includes:
*   Creating an internal service endpoint that receives raw user text input.
*   Calling the AI/ML task extraction service and handling its structured output.
*   Mapping the extracted data to the `Task` data model.
*   Implementing logic to create or update tasks based on the parsed information, possibly requiring user confirmation for ambiguous cases.
*   Ensuring robust error handling and fallback mechanisms if NLP parsing fails.
