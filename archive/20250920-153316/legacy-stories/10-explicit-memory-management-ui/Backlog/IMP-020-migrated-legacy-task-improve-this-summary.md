## Summary
Implement Backend API for Deleting/Forgetting Specific Memories

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Cascading Deletion: Consider if any related data needs to be deleted or anonymized
- [ ] Soft Delete vs. Hard Delete: Implement a hard delete for explicit 'forget' action

title: Implement Backend API for Deleting/Forgetting Specific Memories
responsibleArea: Full-stack Software Engineer
---
Develop a secure backend API endpoint to allow authenticated users to explicitly 'forget' (delete) specific pieces of their personal memory data.
*   Endpoint: `DELETE /api/v1/memories/{memoryId}` (or similar).
*   Authentication: OAuth2.0 integration.
*   Database Deletion: Remove relevant entries from PostgreSQL and ensure corresponding vectors are removed from Pinecone/Weaviate.
*   Cascading Deletion: Consider if any related data needs to be deleted or anonymized.
*   Soft Delete vs. Hard Delete: Implement a hard delete for explicit 'forget' action.
