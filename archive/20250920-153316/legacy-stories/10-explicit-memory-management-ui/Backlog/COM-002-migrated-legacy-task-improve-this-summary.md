## Summary
Comprehensive Testing for Explicit Memory Management Feature

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Functional Testing:**
- [ ] Verify memory retrieval displays correct data
- [ ] Verify memory editing correctly updates data in UI and backend
- [ ] Verify memory deletion removes data from UI and backend
- [ ] Test edge cases (empty memory list, very long memories)
- [ ] Test pagination/filtering
- [ ] **Integration Testing:**
- [ ] Confirm backend APIs interact correctly with PostgreSQL and Pinecone/Weaviate
- [ ] Verify frontend UI correctly consumes backend APIs
- [ ] **Security Testing:**
- [ ] Ensure only authorized users can access/modify their own memories
- [ ] Test for common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection)
- [ ] **Performance Testing:**
- [ ] Evaluate API response times and UI responsiveness with varying memory loads
- [ ] **AI Impact Verification:**
- [ ] Confirm that 'forgotten' memories are no longer used by the AI in new interactions
- [ ] Confirm edited memories are reflected in AI's responses
