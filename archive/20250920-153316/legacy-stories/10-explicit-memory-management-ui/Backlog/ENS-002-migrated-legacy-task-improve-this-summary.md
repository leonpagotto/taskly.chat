## Summary
Ensure Memory Management Operations Impact AI Retrieval

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] For updates: Trigger re-embedding of modified memory content and update/replace corresponding vectors in the vector database
- [ ] For deletions: Ensure the corresponding vectors and any associated metadata are permanently removed from the vector database
- [ ] Verify the AI assistant no longer references 'forgotten' information in new conversations
- [ ] Monitor vector store performance during updates/deletions

## Implementation Notes

Refine the AI backend logic to ensure that memory updates and deletions are accurately reflected in the vector memory store (Pinecone/Weaviate) and impact future AI contextual retrieval.
*   For updates: Trigger re-embedding of modified memory content and update/replace corresponding vectors in the vector database.
*   For deletions: Ensure the corresponding vectors and any associated metadata are permanently removed from the vector database.
*   Verify the AI assistant no longer references 'forgotten' information in new conversations.
*   Monitor vector store performance during updates/deletions.
