## Summary
Quality Assurance for Global AI Instructions Feature

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Frontend Testing:**
- [ ] Verify UI rendering, input field functionality, and responsiveness
- [ ] Test client-side validation messages and saving/loading states
- [ ] Ensure all instruction types (tone, detail, custom) can be set and displayed correctly
- [ ] **Backend API Testing:**
- [ ] Test `GET` and `PUT` endpoints with valid, invalid, and edge-case data
- [ ] Verify authentication and authorization controls
- [ ] Confirm data persistence and retrieval accuracy from the database
- [ ] **AI Behavior Testing:**
- [ ] Design test cases for various global instruction combinations (e.g., 'formal tone, high detail', 'casual tone, concise')
- [ ] Verify that AI responses consistently align with the set instructions in different conversational contexts and task types
- [ ] Identify any scenarios where instructions might be ignored or lead to unexpected AI behavior
- [ ] **Performance Testing:** Assess the impact of instruction retrieval and application on AI response times
- [ ] **Security Testing:** Conduct basic security checks for unauthorized access or data manipulation
